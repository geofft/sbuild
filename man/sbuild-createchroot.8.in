.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-createchroot\fR runs
.BR debootstrap (1)
to create a chroot suitable for building packages with sbuild.  Note that while
debootstrap may be used directly, sbuild\-createchroot performs additional
setup tasks such as adding additional packages and configuring various files in
the chroot.  Invoking sbuild\-createchroot is functionally equivalent to
running \f[CB]debootstrap\ \-\-variant=buildd
\-\-include=fakeroot,build\-essential\fP, then editing
\fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fP and \fI/etc/hosts\fP by hand.
.PP
The newly-created chroot is set up to work with
.BR schroot (1)
by creating a chroot definition file under \fI/etc/schroot/chroot.d\fP.  This
should be edited to finish the chroot configuration after
sbuild\-createchroot has completed.
.PP
\fBbuildd\-create\-chroot\fP, like \fBsbuild\-createchroot\fR, runs
.BR debootstrap (1)
to create a chroot for package building.  However, this creates a chroot
specifically for
.BR buildd (1)
with an additional mandatory option to specify a user who will be granted sudo
access inside the chroot.  This script mainly differs in its additional
customisation of \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fP to use incoming.debian.org and
security-master.debian.org.  It also removes some packages from the
newly-created chroot.  Unless you are setting up an official Debian build
daemon, \fBsbuild\-createchroot\fP should be used instead.  The extra
functionality will be merged into \fBsbuild\-createchroot\fP in the future.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP

.SS Debootstrap options
Note that
.BR debootstrap (1)
is the canonical reference for the meaning of the options; they are passed
directly to debootstrap.
.TP
.BR \-\-arch=\fIarch\fP
Set the target architecture.  This may be used if dpkg is not already
installed.  See also \fI\-\-foreign\fP, below.
.TP
.BR \-\-foreign
Only perform the initial unpack phase of bootstrapping.  This is required if
the target and host architectures do not match.  Note that debootstrap requires
running by hand to complete installation; run the debootstrap
\fI/debootstrap/debootstrap\fP installed in \fITARGET-DIRECTORY\fP to complete
the installation.
.TP
.BR \-\-resolve-deps
Automatically resolve missing dependencies.  This is the default.
.TP
.BR \-\-no-resolve-deps
Do not automatically resolve missing dependencies.
.TP
.BR \-\-keep-debootstrap-dir
Don't delete the \fI/debootstrap\fP directory in \fITARGET-DIRECTORY\fP after
completing the installation.
.TP
.BR "\-\-include=\fIpackage1[,package2,[packagen]]\fP"
Comma separated list of packages which will be added to the list of packages to
download and extract.
.TP
.BR "\-\-exclude=\fIpackage1[,package2,[packagen]]\fP"
Comma separated list of packages which will be removed from the list of
packages to download and extract. Note that this can remove essential packages,
so use with extreme care.
.TP
.BR "\-\-components=\fIcomponent1[,component2,[componentn]]\fP"
Comma separated list of archive components to use (e.g. \[oq]main\[cq],
\[oq]contrib\[cq], \[oq]non-free\[cq]).  Defaults to \[oq]main\[cq].
.TP
.BR "\-\-keyring=\fIkeyring-file\fP"
Download signatures for retrieved \fIRelease\fP files and check them against
\fIkeyring-file\fP.  By default \fI/etc/apt/trusted.gpg\fP is used.  Set to an
empty string to disable signature checking.
.TP
.B SUITE
The distribution to bootstrap (e.g. \[oq]sarge\[cq], \[oq]etch\[cq],
\[oq]lenny\[cq], \[oq]sid\[cq]).  A complete list may be found in
\fI/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts\fP.
.TP
.B TARGET-DIRECTORY
The directory to create the chroot in.  The directory will be created if it
does not already exist.
.TP
.B DEBIAN-MIRROR-URI
An \f[CR]http://\fP, \f[CR]file:///\fP, or \f[CR]ssh:///\fP URI
pointing to a suitable archive mirror.
.TP
.B SCRIPT
debootstrap script to run.  Not typically required.
.SS sbuild\-createchroot behaviour
.TP
.BR "\-\-setup\-only"
Don't run debootstrap.  Only perform the setup tasks on an already existing
chroot.  This is useful for converting an existing chroot for use with sbuild
which has already been created using a tool such as debootstrap.
.TP
.BR \-\-make\-sbuild\-tarball=\fIfile\fP
Create a bootstrapped file type chroot ready for use with sbuild and save it as
\fIfile\fP. The compression format used for the tarball is dependent on the file
extension used in \fIfile\fP. See the \fBTARBALL FILE\fP section for more
details.
.TP
.BR \-\-keep\-sbuild\-chroot\-dir
Don't delete the directory used for creating a file type chroot. This option
does nothing if not creating a file type chroot.
.SH TARBALL FILE
When creating an sbuild tarball \fIfile\fP, the compression format used to
generate the tarball depends on the entension used in \fIfile\fP. Here is a
listing of the extensions that will be detected and what format the tarball will
be generated as.
.TP
.BR *.tar
Generates an uncompressed tarball.
.TP
.BR *.tar.gz|*.tgz
Generates a compressed tarball using gzip.
.TP
.BR *.tar.bz2|*.tbz
Generates a compressed tarball using bzip2.
.TP
.BR *.tar.lz|*.tlz
Generates a compressed tarball using lzip.
.TP
.BR *.tar.xz|*.txz
Generates a compressed tarball using xz.
.PP
If no extension is specified, sbuild\-createchroot will rename \fIfile\fP to
\fIfile.tar.gz\fP and generate \fIfile.tar.gz\fP as a compressed tarball using gzip.
.SH EXAMPLES
To create a plain type sid (unstable) chroot in \fI/srv/chroot/unstable\fP using
the \fIftp.uk.debian.org\fP Debian mirror:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-createchroot sid /srv/chroot/unstable \fP\fP\\
.br
\f[CB]    http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian\fP\[CR]
.PP
To create a bootstrapped file type sid (unstable) chroot ready for use with
sbuild and saved in \fI/var/cache/sbuild/sbuild.tar.gz\fP using the
\fIftp.uk.debian.org\fP Debian mirror and using a temporary directory as the
target:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-createchroot \fP\fP\\
.br
    \-\-make\-sbuild\-tarball=/var/cache/sbuild/sbuild.tar.gz \fP\fP\\
.br
    sid `mktemp \-d` \fP\fP\\
.br
\f[CB]    http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian\fP\[CR]
.SH HISTORY
sbuild\-createchroot was previously known as \fBbuildd.chroot\fP.
buildd.chroot performed exactly the same tasks, but additionally created a
number of directories in the chroot for use by sbuild.  This is now done by
.BR schroot (1).
