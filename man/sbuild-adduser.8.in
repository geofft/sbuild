.TH SBUILD\-ADDUSER 1 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
sbuild\-adduser \- add an sbuild user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbuild\-adduser
.B user1
.RB "[ " user2 " [ " user\f[BI]n\fP... ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-adduser\fR adds the specified users to the \fIsbuild\fP group,
granting them the privelege to build packages with
.BR sbuild (1).
The 
.BR schroot (1)
configuration must permit the user to obtain root permissions in the chroot via
the \f[CI]root\-users\fP and \f[CI]root\-groups\fP options in
\fIschroot.conf\fP, because this is required to install and remove
build-dependencies inside the chroot.  This is normally done using the
\fIsbuild\fP group, but additional users or groups may be added in order to
grant finer-grained permissions, for example to restrict individual users to
particular chroots.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I user
The user to be granted sbuild access.
.SH EXAMPLES
To allow user \fIrleigh\fP sbuild access:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-adduser rleigh\fP\fP
