.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of sbuild.  This version is
maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\fR rebuilds Debian binary packages from the corresponding Debian
source, installing any missing source dependencies.  The build takes place in a
dedicated clean build environment (chroot), rather than on the host system.
.PP
\fBsbuild\fR can fetch the Debian source over a network, or it can use
locally available sources.
.PP
sbuild is given a list of packages to process as the arguments
\fBPACKAGE\f[BI]i\fP[.dsc]\fR. These arguments are in the form of either
debianized package source directories, a source package name along with a
version in the form \fIpackage_version\fP, or a .dsc file. If no arguments are
given, the current working directory is passed as an argument.
.PP
For arguments given as source directories, dpkg-source is first run to produce a
source .dsc file. Then, the package is built using the .dsc produced. For
arguments in the form \fIpackage_version\fP, apt is used to download the source
package. For arguments given as a .dsc file, sbuild builds the source packages
directly. For .dsc files in remote locations, the source packages are downloaded
first, then built.
.PP
It is also possible to run external commands with sbuild. See the section
\fBEXTERNAL COMMANDS\fR for more on this.
.PP
\fBsbuild\fR mails the build logs to a user.  It is configured by the
configuration files \fI/etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf\fP and \fI~/.sbuildrc\fP.  An
example sbuildrc is available in
\fI/usr/share/doc/sbuild/examples/example.sbuildrc\fP.
.PP
You can build either using a local package with its .dsc file or a
remote one by specifying an explicit dpkg version.
.PP
Note: When using schroot (recommended), the chroot having the name (or alias)
of the specified distribution will be used; schroot uses a chroot named
\fI$distribution\-$arch-sbuild\fP, \fI$distribution\-sbuild\fP,
\fI$distribution\-$arch\fP or \fI$distribution\fP, in that order of preference.
The \-c or \-\-chroot option may be used to override the chroot to be
used. When configured to use sudo (deprecated), sbuild will look for a symlink
to a chroot with the same name as the distribution specified.  sbuild will use
a symlink to the chroot located in \fI/etc/sbuild/chroot/$distribution\fP, or
must be run in a directory containing a \fIchroot\-$distribution\fP symlink to
the chroot (not recommended, but done for backward compatibility).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display this manual.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print version information.
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-depends=\fIdependency\fP"

.BR "\-\-add\-conflicts=\fIdependency\fP"
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-depends\-indep=\fIdependency\fP"
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-conflicts\-indep=\fIdependency\fP"
These options add a build dependencies to the source package being built, in
addition to the build dependency information specified in debian/control.
These dependencies will be concatenated directly to the Build-Depends,
Build-Conflicts, Build-Depends-Indep and Build-Conflicts-Indep dependencies,
respectively.  The options may be used any number of times to add multiple
dependencies.  The format is identical to the format used in debian/control.
.TP
.BR "\-\-arch=\fIarchitecture\fP"
Build using the architecture specified.  A chroot named
\fI$distribution\-$arch-sbuild\fP or \fI$distribution\-arch\fP is searched for,
in that order of preference.  The chroot must be installed and configured
appropriately to build as that architecture, e.g. using
\fIpersonality=linux32\fP to build i386 packages on an amd64 system.
.TP
.BR \-A ", " "\-\-arch\-all"
Also build Architecture: all packages, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage \-b

Pass the specified option directly to dpkg\-buildpackage.
.TP
.BR \-\-debbuildopts=\fIoptions\fP
Pass the specified options directly to dpkg\-buildpackage.  The options should
be separated by spaces.  If any options contain spaces, use \-\-debbuildopt
instead.
.TP
.BR \-\-dpkg\-source\-opt=\fIoptions\fP
Pass the specified options directly to dpkg-source. This is only used when
creating a source package from a Debianized source directory.

build. Possible values are \fBalways\fR, \fBnever\fR, and \fBsuccessful\fR.
.TP
.BR "\-\-purge\-deps=\fIpurge-mode\fP"
\fIpurge-mode\fR determines if the build dependencies will be removed after a
build. Possible values are \fBalways\fR, \fBnever\fR, and \fBsuccessful\fR.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " "\-\-source"
Also build source package, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage without \-B.
.TP
.BR "\-\-no-source"

is the opposite of \-\-source.
.TP
.BR "\-\-force\-orig\-source"
When used with in conjunction with \-s, this option forces the inclusion of the
orig.tar.gz file in the generated .changes file, even in cases where it would
not normally be included, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage \-sa.

.TP
.BR "\-\-make\-binNMU=\fIchangelog-entry\fP"
With this option, \fBsbuild\fR will create a new changelog entry in
debian/changelog of every package built. The version number will be in the
format for binary-only NMUs (see \-\-binNMU); the maintainer is set to the
maintainer name configured for \fBsbuild\fR. \fIchangelog-entry\fR will be used
as the changelog entry following \[lq]Binary-only non-maintainer upload for
ARCH -- no source changes\[rq]. Please note that the versions in the
\fIPACKAGE_VERSION[.dsc]\fR arguments still have to be the unmodified (non-NMU
ones) so that the sources can be found. The version number in log files and
mails will be modified by \fBsbuild\fR automatically.
.TP
.BR "\-\-binNMU=\fINMU-version\fP"
The version number of the binary NMU.  This should be used in conjunction with
\-\-make\-binNMU.  \fIversion\fP is a single number for the (+b\fIn\fR) format
used for binary NMUs.
.TP
.BR "\-\-append\-to\-version=\fIstring\fP"
This option is similar to --make-binNMU except that it allows the user to
specify an arbitrary string to be appended to the version number (immediately
before the '+' in the Debian revision if --make-binNMU is also provided).
.TP
.BR \-\-run\-lintian

specified, piuparts will be launched via sudo.
.TP
.BR \-\-piuparts\-root\-args=\fIoptions\fP
Add arguments that are used to launch piuparts as root. If no arguments are
specified, piuparts will be launched via sudo.
.TP
.BR \-\-pre\-build\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run this command before a build starts. This option can be used multiple times
to add multiple commands.
.TP
.BR \-\-chroot\-setup\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run these commands when a chroot is setup, before deps are installed. This
option can be used multiple times to add multiple commands.
.TP
.BR \-\-chroot\-cleanup\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run these commands when a chroot is cleaned up, before build directory is
purged. This option can be used multiple times to add multiple commands.
.TP
.BR \-\-post\-build\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run this command after a successful build. This option can be used multiple
times to add multiple commands.
.TP
.BR \-\-log\-external\-command\-output
Write output from external commands to the build log.
.TP
.BR \-\-log\-external\-command\-error
Write error output from external commands to the build log.
.TP
.BR "\-\-setup\-hook=\fIhook-script\fP" " " \fBDEPRECATED\fP
This option is deprecated. Use of this option will add \fIhook-script\fP to the
external commands to run via \fIchroot-setup-commands\fP.
.TP
.BR "\-\-build\-dep\-resolver=\fIresolver\fP"
Use the specified resolver to handle selecting the build dependencies.
Supported resolvers are \fIinternal\fP (the default) and \fIaptitude\fP.  The
latter tries to be smarter but is also slower.  It may be of some help when
trying to pull build dependencies from an extra suite, like \fIexperimental\fP.
.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
Support to run external commands during an sbuild run is provided. A set of
external commands can be run at various stages of a build. Providing commands to
run is done through the appropriate options given on the command line and
through the use of the configuration files. In the configuration file, the list
of commands to run are placed in a hash of arrays of arrays of strings
corresponding to the commands to run.
.PP
Here's an example of how to edit the configuration files to run "foo" and "bar"
with arguments before a build starts.
.PP
\f[CB]$external_commands = {\fP
.br
\f[CB]    "pre-build-commands" => [\fP
.br
\f[CB]        ['foo', 'arg1', 'arg2'],\fP
.br
\f[CB]        ['bar', 'arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3'],\fP
.br
\f[CB]    ],
.br
\f[CB]};\fP
.PP
Hash keys for commands to run at other stages have the same name as their
corresponding command-line option name without the preceding '--'.
.PP
Here's an example of how to do the same with the previous example, except using
the \fI\-\-pre\-build\-commands\fP option.
.PP
\f[CB]$ sbuild \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      \-\-pre\-build\-commands='foo arg1 arg2' \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      \-\-pre\-build\-commands='bar arg1 arg2 arg3'\fP
.PP
Besides running external commands, sbuild can also detect the use of certain
percent escapes given as arguments. These are used to allow for a command to be
supplied with a certain argument depending on the escape given.
For example, it could be possible to have an external command be given the
path to a .changes file.
.PP
Here is a listing of keywords and a description of what it's converted to.
.TP
\fB%%\fR
Used to escape a '\fI%\fP'.
.TP
\fB%d\fR, \fB%SBUILD_DSC\fR
These escapes are converted to the absolute path to a package's .dsc file.
.TP
\fB%c\fR, \fB%SBUILD_CHANGES\fR
These escapes are converted to the absolute path to a package's source .changes
file.
.PP
Percent escapes are only substituted when an appropriate value is defined for
them. At other times, it is left unchanged. For example, a .changes file is only
defined at the end of a build, so using \fI%c\fR will only be substituted for
post-build-commands.
.PP
Here's an example of using an escape to run a program foo on a .changes file
after a build is done.
.PP
\f[CB]$ sbuild \-\-post\-build\-commands \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      'foo %SBUILD_CHANGES'\fP
.PP
One final note, external commands are processed in the order they are given.
Also, the commands given in a configuration file are processed first, then the
commands given through the command line options.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are used by \fBsbuild\fR:
.IP "HOME"
The home directory of the user.
.IP "LOGNAME"
Used in lockfiles.
.IP "sourcebase"
A URL for a Debian source distribution; generated by sbuild for scripts in
source-dependencies.
.IP "binarybase"
A URL for a Debian binary distribution; generated by sbuild for scripts in
source-dependencies.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf
Configuration, maintained by the system administrator.  This may be used to
override the defaults.
.TP
.I /etc/sbuild/chroot
Directory containing symbolic links to chroots.  This is only used for sudo
chroot access; schroot access uses the schroot chroot configuration.
.TP
.I ~/.sbuildrc
User-specific configuration.
.TP
.I /var/lib/sbuild
Build statistics, source dependencies and lock files.
