.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-debuild\fR rebuilds Debian binary packages from the corresponding
Debian source in a manner similar to debuild.
.PP
sbuild\-debuild is given a list of packages to process as the arguments
\fBPACKAGE\f[BI]i\fP[.dsc]\fR. These arguments are in the form of either
debianized package source directories or a .dsc file.
.PP
For arguments given as source directories, dpkg-buildpackage is first run to
produce a source .dsc file. Then, the package is built using the .dsc produced.
For arguments given as .dsc files, running dpkg-buildpackage is skipped
altogether. If no arguments are given, sbuild-debuild acts on the current
working directory as a source directory to process.
.PP
Before a package is built, sbuild-debuild first changes into the directory where
the corresponding .dsc file resides.
.PP
After a successful build, if lintian is installed on the system, lintian is run
on the resulting .changes file produced after a build.
.PP
In between each run of dpkg-buildpackage, sbuild, and lintian for a package,
a list of commands can be run, similar to running hooks, except that arguments
can be given and "special" keywords can be given as an argument to these
commands to have sbuild-debuild convert them into various arguments. See the
section \fBEXTERNAL COMMANDS\fR for more on this.
.PP
The exit status from sbuild-debuild is either 0 or 1. When a package is
processed, if dpkg-buildpackage, sbuild, or lintian fails, processing of that
package is stopped immediately and processing of the next package is started
instead. For external commands, if an external command fails, the next external
command is run but processing of a package is not halted. If at any point the
processing of a package failed or an external command failed, sbuild-debuild is
marked to exit with value 1 (i.e. failure), otherwise it exits with value 0
(i.e. success).

.SH CONFIG FILES
.TP
.I /etc/sbuild/sbuild-debuild.conf
Configuration, maintained by the system administrator.  This may be used to
override the defaults.
.TP
.I ~/.sbuild-debuildrc
User-specific configuration.
.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
Support to run external commands during an sbuild-debuild run is provided. A set
of external commands can be run before running dpkg-buildpackage, before running
sbuild, before running lintian, and before ending processing of a package.
Providing commands to run is done through the \fI\-\-pre\-*\-commands\fP options
given on the command line and through the use of the configuration files. In the
configuration file, the list of commands to run are placed in an array of
strings corresponding to the commands to run.
.PP
Here's an example of how to edit the configuration files to run "foo" and "bar"
with arguments before dpkg-buildpackage is run.
.PP
\f[CB]$pre_dpkg_buildpackage_commands = ['foo arg1 arg2',\fP
.br
\f[CB]                                   'bar arg1 arg2 arg3',\fP
.br
\f[CB]                                  ];\fP
.PP
Here's an example of how to do the same with the previous example, except using
the \fI\-\-pre\-dpkg\-buildpackage\-commands\fP option.
.PP
\f[CB]$ sbuild\-debuild \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      \-\-pre\-dpkg\-buildpackage\-commands 'foo arg1 arg2' \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      \-\-pre\-dpkg\-buildpackage\-commands 'bar arg1 arg2 arg3'\fP
.PP
Besides running external commands, sbuild\-debuild can also detect the use of
certain keywords given as arguments. These keywords are used to allow for a
command to be supplied with a certain argument depending on the keyword given.
For example, it could be possible to have an external command be given the
path to a .changes file.
.PP
Here is a listing of keywords and a description of what it's converted to.
.IP \fB\@SBUILD_DEBUILD_DSC\@\fR
This keyword is converted to the absolute path to a package's .dsc file.
.IP \fB\@SBUILD_DEBUILD_SOURCE_CHANGES\@\fR
This keyword is converted to the absolute path to a package's source .changes
file.
.IP \fB\@SBUILD_DEBUILD_BIN_CHANGES\@\fR
This keyword is converted to the absolute path to a package's .changes file
depending on architecture.
.PP
Here's an example of using a keyword to run piuparts on a .changes file before
the processing of a package ends.
.PP
\f[CB]$ sbuild\-debuild \-\-pre\-exit\-commands \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      'piuparts \@SBUILD_DEBUILD_BIN_CHANGES\@'\fP
.PP
One final note, external commands are processed in the order they are given.
Also, the commands given in a configuration file are processed first, then the
commands given through the command line options.
