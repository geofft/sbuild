.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of wanna\-build.  This version
is maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.PP
There is also a version maintained by Ryan Murray which is adapted to build
daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally
capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a number of enhancements aimed at
making it suitable for use by end-users.
.PP
Please note that this manual page was created from the README files
accompanying the wanna\-build sources and may be outdated and incorrect in
places, as well as containing duplicated information.  Improvements to the
documentation are welcome.
.SH DESCRIPTION
wanna\-build is intended to coordinate package building, and to make it easy to
determine which packages need recompilation.
.SH OVERVIEW
wanna\-build is an automatic distributed build system intended to
recompile Debian binary packages from the Debian source.  The system consists
of seven components:
.PS

lineht = 0.25;

.PE
.TP
Quinn-Diff
This program determines which packages need to be recompiled.  It is
optional; any program which produces the same output could be used in
its place.  quinn\-diff may be run on the same machine as wanna\-build
or on any other machine.
.TP
Packages
The Packages file from an ftp site (preferablly all build daemons
should use the same ftp mirror as wanna\-build); wanna\-build uses the
information to determine which packages have been installed (after
they've been `uploaded'), and which packages can now be built (after
they've been put on `dep-wait').
.TP
Wanna\-Build
The heart of the build system.  This is a database of packages which
need to be rebuilt.  The packages can be in several states
(e.g. `needs-build', `failed', `dep-wait' etc.).  The database does
full locking, so as long as build daemons and humans all register what
they want to build via wanna\-build, there will be no duplication of
work.
.TP
Build Daemon
The build daemon can be used on a permanently connected machine to
ensure packages are being compiled continuously.  It gets a list of
packages to build from the wanna\-build database and builds them with
sbuild.  The logs of the build are then sent to the human
adminstrator.
.TP
Sbuild
This is the script used to build Debian source packages.
.TP
Adminstrator
Each build daemon must have a human adminstrator who looks at each build logs
and sends a response.  The response can be a signed .changes file, in which
case the build daemon will upload the package, or it can be a `fail' response
along with a reason, in which case the build daemon will notify the
wanna\-build database about the change of state for the package.
.TP
Developers
Developers can compile and upload packages without duplication of work
if they register their intent with wanna\-build.  Developers are
recommended to use sbuild, pbuilder, or something similar, but there's
nothing that requires this.
.SH OPTIONS
As usual, a double minus ("\-\-") stops option processing, and remaining
arguments will be treated as non-options, even if they start with a '\-'.
.SS General options
.TP
\-v, \-\-verbose
Verbose execution.  Be somewhat more verbose, and print revision number at
start.
.SS Actions
.TP
\-\-take
Take package for building (this is the default operation).
.TP
\-f, \-\-failed
Record in database that a build failed due to deficiencies in the
package (that are not fixable without a new source version).
.TP
\-u, \-\-uploaded
Record in the database that the packages build correctly and were
uploaded.
.TP
\-n, \-\-no\-build
Record in the database that the packages are not desired for m68k and
should not appear in listings even if they are out of date.
.TP
\-\-dep\-wait
Record in the database that the packages are waiting for some source
dependencies to become available.  If you see that a package source-depends on
some other package which isn't available yet for your architecture, you best
set the package to state Dep-Wait. You additionally give a list of dependencies
with the \-m option, formatted just like a Depends: field (versioned
dependencies are allowed, but no alternatives). If \-m is not used,
wanna\-build will ask interactively for the dependency list. The package is set
back to state Needs-Build as soon as all the dependencies are known to be
available (detected by \-\-merge\-packages).
.TP
\-d DIST, \-\-dist=DIST
Set distribution on which wanna\-build should work. There are separate
databases for stable, frozen, and unstable. A default distribution is set with
the variable $default_dist in /etc/wanna\-build.conf. The distributions
"stable", "frozen", "unstable" can be abbreviated as 's', 'f', and 'u', resp.
.TP
\-\-forget
This is another action: The named packages (only name, no version) will be
removed from the database completely. This is for maintenance purposes, not
for day-by-day use. A mail will be sent to the database maintainer.
.TP
\-\-give\-back
Mark a package as ready to build that is in state Building, Built or
Build-Attempted. To give back a package in state Failed, use \-\-override.  If
you decide to stop building a package that you have taken before (i.e., which
is in state Building and you're the builder), but that package hasn't failed,
you can give it back with this option.  The state changes back to Needs-Build.
.TP
\-\-merge\-quinn
Merge quinn\-diff output into database.
.TP
\-\-merge\-packages
Merge Packages files into database.
.TP
\-\-pretend\-avail
Pretend that given packages are available now and give
free packages waiting for them.
.TP
.SS Information
\-i \fIsource-package\fP, \-\-info \fIsource-package\fP
Show information for source package.
.TP
\-l \fIstate\fP, \-\-list=\fIstate\fP:
List all packages in state \fIstate\fP; can be combined with \-U to
restrict to a specific user; \fIstate\fP can also be 'all'.
.SS Behaviour
.TP
\-m \fImessage\fP, \-\-message=\fImessage\fP
Give reason why package failed or source dependency list (used with
\-f, \-\-dep\-wait, and \-\-binNMU).
Set fail message for \-\-failed. If not set on the command line, wanna\-build
will ask interactively for it.
Set the dependencies that a package should wait for if used with
\-\-dep\-wait. Again, wanna\-build will ask interactively for the dependencies
if this option isn't given.
.TP
\-o, \-\-override
Override another user's lock on a package, i.e. take it over; a
notification will be mailed to the other user.
Take over a package from somebody else. This is possible for packages in
state Building or Failed. The new state will be Building, and the owner
changes. A mail notice will be sent to the previous owner.
.TP
\-O ORDER, \-\-order=ORDER
Select criteria for how to order \-\-list output (see above).
.TP
\-U \fIuser\fP, \-\-user=\fIuser\fP
Select user name for which listings should apply, if not given all
users are listed.  if \-l is missing, set user name to be entered in
db; usually automatically chosen.
Set the user whose name is logged with the transaction, or who will be
entered in the database as builder of the package (\-\-take). The default is
the login name of the caller, but for maintenance purposes it can be
changed on the command line.
.TP
\-c CATEGORY, \-\-category=CATEGORY
Set/change the failed category (with \-\-failed) or list only failed packages
in this category (with \-\-list). For more details on failed categories,
please see the file README.failcat.
.TP
\-a DAYS, \-\-min\-age=DAYS
Used together with \-\-list. List only packages whose state change is at
least DAYS ago. Days can be negative, then only packages at most DAYS
old are listed.
.TP
\-\-max\-age=DAYS
Same as the above, but specifies a maximum age (same meaning as negative
DAYS in \-\-min\-days). DAYS can be negativ here, too, meaning a minimum age
again.
.TP
\-\-correct\-compare
Use dpkg \-\-compare\-versions for version comparisons, as it is really
correct. However, spawning a dpkg process for every comparison is very
time-consuming, so the default is to use the internal implementation.  (Which
has been derived from the dpkg source.)
.TP
.SS Administration
\-\-import \fIfile\fP
Import database from an ASCII file \fIfile\fP into the internal database. This
is NOT intended for public use. \fBCaution\fP: the internal database is cleared
before the import, so that packages can also be deleted by manual editing. But
this also means that you can also easily destroy the whole DB with this option!
.TP
\-\-export \fIfile\fP
Export database to an ASCII file \fIfile\fP.  The internal database is in
Berkeley DB hash format, to speed up operation. The file format is somewhat
similar to a Packages file, but with different keywords. The \-\-export option
is not intended for public use, but for the database maintainer to view the
contents of the DB directly, or the make manual changes.
.TP
\-\-create\-maintenance\-lock
This action creates a master lock file for all databases. All operations except
\-\-merge\-packages and \-\-merge\-quinn will block until this master lock is
gone. The purpose of this lock is to interception of other operation in the
middle of a database update that must be done sequentially for different
distributions, but the merged data nevertheless belong together.  The
maintenance lock is used by the do\-merge\-quinn and do\-merge\-packages
scripts.
.TP
\-\-remove\-maintenance\-lock
Remove a master lock file again.
.TP
\-\-manual\-edit
Lock the database, export it, start an editor for it, and after the editor
exists, re-import the modified file. Then the db is unlocked again. This option
is meant for manual fixes to the database, with full locking.
.TP
\-\-create\-db
Since wanna\-build refuses to open (and thus create) non-existing databases
now, this option is necessary if you really want to create a not-yet-existing
db.
.TP
\-\-introduce\-epochs
This was needed when an old database was updated to contain epochs. As now all
databases should include epochs, this option should be unneeded.
.SH ALIASES
wanna\-build includes a set of aliases (found in \*[WANNA_BUILD_LIBEXEC_DIR])
which save typing the operation option (add the directory to the PATH in your
environment).  The following aliases exist:

.SH DATABASE STATES
wanna\-build maintains a database (/var/lib/wanna\-build/build\-db\-DIST)
in which it keeps information about all the packages and their
states. These states can be:
.TP
Installed
The source and binary version of a package match, no action is needed.
.TP
Needs-Build
The source version is newer than the binary version for this architecture, so
the package needs recompilation.
.TP
Building
Someone has taken the package and currently builds it.
.TP
Uploaded
A previous rebuild has been successfull, and the resulting binary package has
been uploaded, but it is not installed into the archive yet.
.TP
Failed
A previous build failed for some reason, and a new version of the source
package is needed to fix this. This means you don't need to try to recompile
this version of the package again, it's in vain. The "Failed" state is reset if
a new source version appears (but there are some warnings that it previously
failed).
.TP
Dep-Wait
A previous build failed because it needs some other package (or newer version
of) that isn't available yet for this architecture. Along with this state a
dependency list is stored (normal Depends: syntax and features). Once all those
dependencies are known to be available (are in state Installed and satisfying
version requirements if present), the package changes state to Needs-Build
again.
.TP
Not-For-Us
The package isn't suitable for this architecture for some reason.  (E.g.,
isdnutils is useless on m68k.) The package is (nearly) completely ignored by
wanna\-build and never will appear in needs-build lists, even if new source
versions come up.
.TP
Failed-Removed
This is a rather special state... It occurs if a package disappears from
quinn\-diff output and was in state Failed before. Such disappearing packages
are usually deleted from the database, but state Failed packages are treated
differently, to avoid loosing the failure messages. Therefore they're put into
this special state, so that they still have an entry, but are otherwise
ignored. If was missing from quinn\-diff due to an error and re-appears later,
it will change back state to Failed as nothing has happened.
.TP
Dep-Wait-Removed
This is similar to Failed-Remove, and this state is entered if a package was in
Dep-Wait and then disappears from quinn\-diff. The state is just to prevent
loosing the dependency information if the package later is listed again (for
example, if the disappearance was a quinn\-diff failure).
.TP
Install-Wait
.TP
Reupload-Wait:
These states handle a special case, the delayed-frozen-installation, which is
described in its own chapter at the end of this document.
.PP
A packages changes states by the various calls to wanna\-build. The usual
process is:
.IP \[bu]
merge\-quinn (run by a cron job) detects that some package needs recompilation
due to a new source version. The state changes from "Installed" to
"Needs-Build", and the version number is updated.
.IP \[bu]
Somebody notices that the package needs rebuilding, and takes it with
.IP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]wanna\-build hello_1.0\-1\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
.IP
The state changes from "Needs-Build" to "Building".
.IP \[bu]
The build is successfull and the job is uploaded. Then the uploader calls
.IP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]uploaded\-build hello_1.0\-1.dsc\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
.IP
The package changes state from "Building" to "Uploaded".
.IP \[bu]
If the package has been installed into the Debian archive by dinstall on
master, it will be in the binary\-ARCH/Packages file eventually some days
later. A cron job calls merge\-packages and this detects that the version that
previously was uploaded is now in there and changes the state from "Uploaded"
to "Installed".
.PP
The wanna\-build call in the second step also serves another purpose: It
detects (and tells you) if somebody else already has taken the package (to
avoid double work), or if the package failed previously. The output could
look like:
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]wanna\-build hello_1.0\-1\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
\f[CR]  hello: NOT OK!\fP
.br
\f[CR]    already taken by rnhodek\fP
.br
.PP
or
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]wanna\-build hello_1.0\-1\fP\fP\[CR]
\f[CR]  hello: NOT OK!\fP
\f[CR]    build of 1.0\-1 failed previously:\fP
\f[CR]      Needs a special source patch to compile for m68k (see #99999)\fP
.PP
For packages that are not taken yet and have no other specialities, you get no
output except you give the \-v (verbose) option.
.PP
The arguments you give to wanna\-build, uploaded\-build, and failed\-build are
rather free-format. The tools just need the package name and the version
number, separated by '_'. Path prefixes and extensions like ".dsc", ".deb",
".changes", ... are ignored. This often allows you to use your shell's filename
completion or cut&paste to enter the arguments.
.PP
uploaded\-build shouldn't fail except the state is wrong (not "Building"), or
you're not the one who has taken the package, or if there is a version
mismatch. But there is no coordination or the like here.
.PP
If a build fails (and the error can't be fixed without source modifications),
you should inform your fellows by calling
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]failed\-build hello_1.0\-1\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
.PP
You will be asked for a failure message that will be put in the database.
It can be more than one line. For example:
.PP
\f[CR]Enter reason for failing (end with '.' alone on its line):\fP
.br
\f[CR]\f[CB]Needs a special source patch to compile for m68k (see #99999)\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
\f[CR]\f[CB]\&.\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
\f[CR]hello: registered as failed\fP
.br
.PP
The failed messages are also useful for keeping failed lists (list\-failed) and
going though it and remembering maintainers about bugs from time to time. If
the package was already in state "Failed", your message will be appended to the
previous one.
.PP
If later a new source version is detected by merging quinn\-diff output, the
state will be reset to "Needs-Build", assuming that the new source version
fixes the problem. For example, if the new version of hello is 1.0\-2 and you
take the package, you'll see:
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]wanna\-build \-v hello_1.0\-2\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
\f[CR]hello: Warning: Previous version failed!\fP
.br
\f[CR]hello: ok\fP
.br
.PP
This should make you cautious and you can look at the fail message:
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]build\-info hello\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
\f[CR]hello:\fP
.br
\f[CR]  Package             : hello\fP
.br
\f[CR]  Version             : 1.0\-2\fP
.br

.br
\f[CR]  State               : Building\fP
.br

.br
\f[CR]  Priority            : optional\fP
.br
\f[CR]  Previous\-State      : Failed\fP
.br
\f[CR]  State\-Change        : 1998 Jun 16 16:17:41\fP
.br
\f[CR]  Notes               : out\-of\-date:libc6\fP
.br
\f[CR]  Old\-Failed          : \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- 1.0\-1 \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\fP
.br
\f[CR] Needs a special source patch to compile for m68k (see #99999)\fP
.br
.PP
Now you can look into the changelog of the package and check if bug #99999
really has been fixed. If it seems unlikely that this version will work, you
can immediately call failed\-build again.
.PP
Besides build\-info, there is the \-\-list option or the list\-* aliases that
retrieve information from the database. The most commonly used command is
list\-needs\-build, which tells you which packages are ready for taking. For
example:
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]list\-needs\-build\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
\f[CR]editors/xemacs19_19.16\-9 [important:uncompiled:libc6:X]\fP
.br
\f[CR]editors/sex_0.16 [optional:uncompiled:libc6:X]\fP
.br
\f[CR]editors/the_2.5\-0.6 [optional:uncompiled:libc6]\fP
.br
\f[CR]editors/xemacs20_20.4\-12 [optional:uncompiled:libc6:X]\fP
.br
\f[CR]Total 4 package(s)\fP
.br
.PP
The output is similar to quinn\-diff intentionally. The difference is that
already taken or uploaded or failed packages aren't listed. quinn\-diff can't
know these things.
.PP
The packages are usually ordered by the following criteria (in this order):
.IP \[bu]
out-of-date/uncompiled (the former come first)
.IP \[bu]
priority (e.g. "required" before "optional")
.IP \[bu]
section (alphabetically)
.IP \[bu]
package name (alphabetically)
.PP
You can also change the sorting with the \-O or \-\-order option. That option
needs an argument that consists of a series of letters. Each letter stands for
one criterium, and the order of the letters decides in which order to apply
these criteria. Available letters are:
.TP
b
builder, alphabetically
.TP
c
out-of-date/uncompiled (out-of-date comes before uncompiled)
.TP
n
package name, alphabetically
.TP
p
priority (required -> important -> ... -> extra)
.TP
s
section name, ordered by some kind of importance
.TP
f
failed category (none > uploaded-fixed-pkg > fix-expected > reminder-sent >
nmu-offered > easy > medium > hard > compiler-error)
.PP
I.e., the default order would be \-\-order=cpsn. If listing failed packages,
the default order becomes fcpsn.
.PP
The other list\-* commands can list packages in other states, e.g.
list\-uploaded would list all packages that have been uploaded, but are not
installed yet. Or list\-building would give you infos on who currently builds
what.
.PP
All the list\-* commands can also take a \-U (\-\-user) option to restrict the
output to a specific user.
.SH
THE DELAYED-FROZEN-INSTALL PROBLEM
.PP
A special problem should be documented here, since wanna\-build tries to handle
it, but nevertheless some manual work is required, and there is a deficiency
you might want to know about.
.PP
If a source upload is for frozen and unstable, the source will be installed in
unstable immediately, but before going to frozen it needs manual acknowledge by
the release manager. (The same can also happen if stable is involved. In the
following frozen+unstable will be used as example, but there are also different
combinations to which the problem applies to: stable+unstable, stable+frozen
(unlikely), stable+frozen+unstable.)  Therefore, quinn\-diff for unstable will
list the package earlier then the one for frozen, and it will be in Needs-Build
in unstable earlier. If now someone takes the unstable package, the state
change is not propagated to frozen, because there is still an older version in
the database. (The same scenario can also happen if the quinn\-diff for frozen
isn't updated for a few days due to malfunctions.)
.PP
Now the builder may not upload the package for frozen and unstable, because he
cannot know if the package will be accepted for frozen. So he must delete
frozen from the Distribution: field in the .changes file. (sbuild does this.)
He should also save the .changes file because he will need it later. (Also this
done automatically by sbuild.) But if the package is accepted for frozen, the
new version will become Needs-Build a few days or so later. To avoid building
the same version again as far as this can be avoided, wanna\-build takes the
following actions:
.IP \[bu]
If a package comes in from quinn\-diff for distribution A and the
Installed-Version: of the same package in another distribution B is equal to
the incoming version, the state in distrib A will not be Needs-Build but
Reupload-Wait.
.IP \[bu]
If a package comes in from quinn\-diff for distribution A and the the same
package in another distribution B has the same version number and is in states
Building or Uploaded, the state in distrib A will not be Needs-Build but
Install-Wait.
.IP \[bu]
If a package comes in from quinn\-diff for distribution A and the the same
package in another distribution B has the same version number and the state
there is Failed or Dep-Wait, the state from B is copied, together with fail
messages or dependencies, resp.
.IP \[bu]
If during \-\-merge\-packages for distribution A the same version of the
package in another distrib B is in state Install-Wait, the state in B is
changed to Reupload-Wait.
.IP \[bu]
Any time a package changes state to Reupload-Wait, a mail is sent to the
previous builder that he should reupload the package for the distribution in
question. The builder is supposed to take the binary packages from a Debian
mirror, and make a new upload based on the .changes he saved after the build
for unstable. The Distribution: should be what wanna\-build tells him in its
mail. (There is a script, buildd-reupload, for this task.)
.PP
This way, a lot of recompilations of the same version can be avoided.
However, unfortunately, not all of them. If another version for unstable is
installed in the archive before the frozen version comes in from
quinn\-diff, the binary packages are already lost and cannot be reuploaded.
.SH FAILURE CATEGORIES
Every package in state Failed can be assigned a category. The
following categories exist:
.IP \[bu]
  easy (e)
.IP \[bu]
  medium (m)
.IP \[bu]
  hard (h)
.IP \[bu]
  compiler-error (c)
.IP \[bu]
  fix-expected (f)
.IP \[bu]
  reminder-sent (r)
.IP \[bu]
  nmu-offered (n)
.IP \[bu]
  uploaded-fixed-pkg (u)
.PP
Additionally, a special category `none' is used if no category has
been assigned.
.PP
Usually, if a package failed recompilation, you report a bug and set
it to Failed. Now you should also assign a category to this failed
package. "easy" is for more or less trivial bugs, like typos or the
like. "medium" is for things that require a bit more effort (e.g.,
writing new configs for your arch) but are still doable with a normal
NMU. "hard" is meant for things that need special bootstrapping, for
programs that segfault and need debugging, and so on. If you know the
package maintainer to fix reported bugs quickly and reliably, you can
also use "fix-expected" as category.
.PP
You can assign a category directly with wanna\-build:
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]failed\-build \-c easy some\-pkg_1.0\-1\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
.PP
or
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]wanna\-build \-c easy some\-pkg_1.0\-1\fP\fP\[CR]
.br
.PP
You can also use one-letter abbreviations for the categories, as mentioned
above in parens. Another way to assign a category is to include them in the
fail message, probably the one that you send back to the build daemon. If the
message starts with [XXX], the XXX will be interpreted as a category and be
assigned to the package. Of course, you can use the abbreviations here,
too. You can also change an existing category by including a new one in a fail
message (that will be appended). That inclusion into a message is usually the
most convenient way to set or change a category.
.PP
From time to time you should make a bug fixing session to check for
old, unfixed bugs. You can easily list such failed packages with the
new \-\-min\-age=DAYS (\-a) option of wanna\-build. For example, I
regularily do
.PP
\f[CR]%\ \f[CB]list\-failed \-a 14\fP\fP\[CR]
.PP
to list all failed packages that haven't been fixed in the last 14 days. The
listing is sorted by categories. You probably can ignore "hard" packages
(except you have lots of spare time now :-)
.PP
For packages that are "easy" or "medium", you can send a reminder to the
maintainer and change the category to "reminder-sent". If a package is in that
category for several days and the maintainer still didn't respond, you should
offer to make a NMU if there is no reaction. The category changes to
"nmu-offered". If a package has that label and is older than (e.g.) 21 days,
you really should do the NMU now.
.PP
Of course, the timings are more or less a subjective choice, and also
can very with importance of the failed package. Simply use common
sense. For really old bugs, you obviously also can skip the reminder
phase.
.PP
If the maintainer replies to a bug report and says he is actively
working on a fix, a good new category is "fix-expected". With this you
note for yourself that a reminder and NMU offer is probably not
necessary (except the package is for too long in this state...)
.PP
If the maintainer says that he already has uploaded a fixed version
(or is about to do this), you can set the category to
"uploaded-fixed-pkg". This again is a note for your bug tracking.
.PP
The above to actions can be easily done with the Emacs functions
buildd\-bug\-change\-category (C\-c C\-a C\-c) and buildd\-comment (C\-c C\-a
C\-a). They both can be called in a reply to the bug report, provided that the
maintainer left the subject unchanged, i.e. it still is in the form
.PP
\f[CR]Re: Bug#XXXX: PACKAGE_VERSION(DIST): blabla\fP
.br
.PP
Those infos are needed to construct a mail with correct subject to
buildd that will call failed\-build then. Obviously, you can also
change the category with buildd\-bug\-comment, by including [CATEGORY]
in the text to be appended.
