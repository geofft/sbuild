.TH SBUILD\-CREATECHROOT 1 "@DATE@" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
sbuild\-createchroot \- create sbuild chroot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbuild\-createchroot
.I suite
.I target-directory
.I debian-mirror-uri
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-createchroot\fR runs
.BR debootstrap (1)
to create a chroot suitable for building packages with sbuild.  Note that while
debootstrap may be used directly, sbuild\-createchroot performs additional
setup tasks such as setting up \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fP to include main,
contrib and non-free archive sections.  Invoking sbuild\-createchroot is
functionally equivalent to running \f[CB]debootstrap\ --variant=buildd\fP, then
editing \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fP by hand.  The \fIbuild\-essential\fP and
\fIfakeroot\fP packages are additionally installed.
.SH OPTIONS
Note that
.BR debootstrap (1)
is the canonical reference for the meaning of the options; they are passed
directory to debootstrap.
.TP
.I suite
The distribution to bootstrap (e.g. \[oq]sarge\[cq], \[oq]etch\[cq],
\[oq]lenny\[cq], \[oq]sid\[cq]).  A complete list may be found in
\fI/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts\fP.
.TP
.I target-directory
The directory to create the chroot in.  The directory will be created if it
does not already exist.
.TP
.I debian-mirror-uri
An \f[CR]http://\fP, \f[CR]file:///\fP, or \f[CR]ssh:///\fP URI
pointing to a suitable archive mirror.
.SH EXAMPLES
To create a sid (unstable) chroot in \fI/srv/chroot/unstable\fP using the
\fIftp.uk.debian.org\fP Debian mirror:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-createchroot sid /srv/chroot/unstable \fP\fP\\
.br
\f[CB]    http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian\fP\[CR]
.SH HISTORY
sbuild\-createchroot was previously known as \fBbuildd.chroot\fP.
buildd.chroot performed exactly the same tasks, but additionally created a
number of directories in the chroot for use by sbuild.  This is now done by
.BR schroot (1).
