.SH NAME
buildd\-watcher \- watch buildd activity

This man page documents the packaged version of buildd\-watcher.  This version

daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally
capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a number of enhancements aimed at
making it suitable for use by end-users.

log files.
