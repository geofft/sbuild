.TH WANNA\-BUILD\-MAIL 1 "\*[RELEASE_DATE]" "Version \*[VERSION]" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
wanna\-build\-mail \- wanna\-build mail interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wanna\-build\-mail
.B package
.br
.B wanna\-build\-catgdbm
.B package
.br
.B wanna\-build\-catmldbm
.B package
.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of wanna\-build.  This version
is maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.PP
There is also a version maintained by Ryan Murray which is adapted to build
daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally
capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a number of enhancements aimed at
making it suitable for use by end-users.
.SH DESCRIPTION
wanna\-build\-mail is used to drive wanna\-build though an email interface.
Set up wanna\-build\-mail as the mail filter for the wanna\-build user on your
system, then when you send this user mail, wanna\-build\-mail will run to
process the mail and query the database with the commands you specify in the
mail.
.PP
The mail processor sends a reply mail with all the program output to the
address the request came from (From: header). Alternatively, it obeys a
Reply-To: header if present.
.SH OVERVIEW
The email subject does not matter.  The body must be signed with PGP, with a
key registered in /var/lib/wanna-build/mail-keyring.pgp. Only these keys are
authorised to use the mail interface.  Additionally, the file mail-users in the
same directory is used to map PGP-key names to user names.
.PP
In the body (the PGP-signed part), you can write commands like:
.PP
\f[CR]wanna-build hello_1.0-1\fP
.br
\f[CR]uploaded tst1_1.0 tst2_0.99a\fP
.br
\f[CR]info hello\fP
.br
\f[CR]list needs-build failed\fP
.SH COMMANDS
The commands below are available. All be be abbreviated to their first letter
and must start in column 0.  An argument \fIpackage_version\fP is the package
name and its version number, as usual with wanna-build.
.TP
.BR wanna-build " package_version "
.TP
.BR uploaded-build " package_version "
.TP
.BR failed-build " package_version "
The failed-build command also needs a failing message. You put this message in
the lines after the command, each line with some whitespace at the start. This
whitespace is stripped for the message actually passed to failed-build. The
first line without whitespace is treated as the next command.
.TP
.BR info package1 " [ " package2 " [ " packagen ]]
Get package information.  No version number is required.
.TP
.BR list\ state1 " [ " state2 " [ " staten ]]
List packages in given states.  Valid states are \fIinstalled\fP,
\fIneeds-build\fP, \fIbuilding\fP, \fIuploaded\fP, \fIfailed\fP,
\fInot-for-us\fP, and additionally \fIall\fP (for any state).
.TP
.BR vlist\ state1 " [ " state2 " [ " staten ]]
\fBvlist\fP is the same as list, but includes a \fI-v\fP option, so that
previous states and old failing messages are printed, too.
.PP
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /var/lib/wanna\-build

.I /var/lib/wanna-build/mail-keyring.pgp
