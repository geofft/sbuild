Welcome to sbuild 0.58.0.  Please read these release notes carefully.

Full installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL file.  The
README file also contains more specific notes regarding building and
configuration.

* Major changes in 0.58.0:

  1) The configuration option @no_auto_upgrade, which was no longer
     used, has been removed.  To prevent packages being upgraded
     automatically, please use sbuild-hold.  See sbuild-hold(1).

  2) The configuration option $chroot_mode has been restored, allowing
     chroot access by both schroot (which remains the default) and
     sudo.

  3) A new configuration option $chroot_split has been added.  This
     allows both schroot and sudo chroot access to be modified to run
     apt/dpkg on the host system.  Note that schroot needs sudo to run
     commands as root on the host system.

* Major changes in 0.57.5:

  1) sbuild-createchroot now supports most of the options found in
     debootstrap.  It no longer adds main and contrib to
     /etc/apt/sources.list in the chroot (the components are now
     specified with --components instead of being hard-coded).

  2) All sbuild commands now support --help and --version options.

  3) sbuild-abort and sbuild have been updated to work with the
     current dpkg-buildpackage and handle build termination
     gracefully.

* Major changes in 0.57.4:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.57.3:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.57.2:

  1) The new dpkg source format is now supported.

  2) The chroot to build in may be specified independently of the
     distribution.

  3) Purging of files in the chroot has been made more reliable, by
     putting all of the build files in a single temporary directory
     which is purged after the build completes.

  4) $mailto no longer needs setting in .sbuildrc if not running as a
     buildd.

  5) An option to always update the APT package list has been added
     ($apt_update in sbuild.conf).

  6) wanna-build, the database used to track which packages need
     rebuilding, has been added as a separate package.

* Major changes in 0.57.1:

  1) While not used in the Debian packaging, the buildd and
     wanna-build sources have been merged from the separate buildd.git
     repository.  They will be built as packages in a future release.

  2) Helper scripts in the Debian package have been moved from
     /usr/lib/sbuild back to /usr/share/sbuild, where they were
     located prior to 0.57.0.

  3) schroot "directory" type chroots are now purged correctly
     following a package build.

* Major changes in 0.57.0:

  1) All programs have been moved from /usr/share/sbuild to /usr/bin
     (with the exception of dobuildlog), with an sbuild- prefix.  In
     some cases, the names have been changed.  The older programs are
     still available under /usr/lib/sbuild.

  2) All programs (with the exception of dobuildlog) now have manual
     pages.

  3) sbuild now runs apt-get with APT::Install-Recommends set to
     false.

  4) sbuild can be optionally configured to use an alternative
     algorithm to compute build dependencies, to allow installation of
     alternative build dependencies.

  5) sbuild-createchroot (formerly buildd.chroot) now creates a fully
     working chroot, with no manual setup required other than adding
     the schroot configuration.
