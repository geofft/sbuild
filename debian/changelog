sbuild (0.43) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - verify_dsc_md5sums(): New function to verify the MD5SUM of files in a
      .dsc file.
    - Add $conf::md5sum for security.
    - fetch_source_files(): Use verify_dsc_md5sums to check for incomplete
      downloads, and redownload sources if needed; also verify again after
      download (Closes: #270439).
    - build(), shutdown(): Quote kill command correctly (Closes: #356686).
    - When using schroot, look for a distribution named
      "$distribution-sbuild" in preference to "$distribution".
    - open_log(), open_pkg_log(): Use fork() rather than tee to multiplex
      log output.
    - close_log(), close_pkg_log(): Close all dup'd log streams, and don't
      kill the child log processes, which avoids dataloss in the pipeline.
    - log_symlink(): New function to create a symbolic link to the current
      package log.  This replaces the use of /bin/ln, which has races if
      concurrent builds use it.
    - open_log(), close_log(): Save a references to the initial STDOUT and
      STDERR, and restore them when the log is closed.
    - open_pkg_log(): Use the saved STDOUT for verbose logging.  This
      prevents the package log being also directed to the build log.
    - setup_options(): Remove unused call to tmpnam().
  * sbuild.1: Document schroot chroot naming.

sbuild (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - get_apt_command_internal(): Always add $main::chroot_apt_options.
    - log_command(): Add an additional priority argument.  If nonzero,
      the message is always logged, otherwise is only logged if debug is
      enabled.
    - get_command_internal(): When running schroot, preserve the user
      environment, needed for APT_CONFIG, DEBIAN_FRONTEND, etc..
    - get_command(), run_command(), exec_command(), get_apt_command(),
      run_apt_command():
      + chdir to $main::cwd to make sure the directory location also exists
        inside the chroot.
      + Add an additional priority argument to control the urgency of the
        log message, and pass this to log_command().
    - get_virtuals(): Remove usage of $main::chroot_apt_options, which is
      added automatically by get_apt_command().
    - get_command(), run_command() and exec_command() only log the full
      command when debugging is enabled, otherwise only the short form is
      logged (Closes: #355043).
    - setup_options():
      + Ensure APT_CONFIG is set to the correct path depending upon the
        chroot_mode.  $chroot_aptconf is the absolute path to the file from
        the host system, while $aptconf is the absolute path when apt is
        run.
      + Only set $main::chroot_apt_options when chroot_mode is "split".
      + Always regenerate apt.conf, because when chroot_mode is changed, it
        will break APT unless rewritten.
      + Don't set "Dir" in $chroot_aptconf when in chroot_mode is "schroot"
        (because apt is run inside the chroot).
    - Remove setpgrp() calls, so that all child processes run in the same
      process group as the parent.
    - Add a $conf::sbuild_mode, used to switch behaviour between user and
      buildd defaults.  The default is "buildd".  This allows package build
      errors to be reported (Closes: #170742).
    - Add a --quiet option, the opposite action to --verbose.
    - open_pkg_log():
      + Use correct Sbuild:: namespace for binNMU_version (Closes: #355861).
      + Create current-distribution symlink in addition to current.
    - Set the in the environment SHELL=/bin/sh, in case the user
      invoking sbuild uses a shell not available inside the chroot.
    - Remove unused variables @dist_parts and $main::nomail.
    - Use correct use syntax for File::Temp and Cwd, and initialise a
      number of variables which would otherwise be undefined, in order
      to remove run-time warnings.
    - Add a number of checks for undefined variables to remove run-time
      warnings.
    - Add -w to the shebang line, so sbuild always runs with warnings
      enabled.
    - All exec commands other than writing logfiles now use exec_command,
      so they get logged.
    - Require /usr/share/sbuild/sbuild.conf and optionally require
      /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf.
    - Use named signals, rather than numbers, for portability.
    - close_log(), close_pkg_log: If verbose is enabled, flush the log and
      wait a second before killing tee, to prevent data loss in the pipeline.
    - $main::verbose is set by default if running on a tty (Closes: #355802).
    - LOG and PLOG are set to autoflush using IO::Handle.
    - $conf::build_dir defaults to $main::cwd if undefined.  It is used as
      the directory containing the build chroots, build logs, and current
      symlinks (Closes: #183022).
    - Always print toolchain packages.  This is done by always calling
      merge_pkg_build_deps(), and running all the way through
      install_deps(), even when the package does not supply any build
      dependencies or conflicts (Closes: #355040).
    - install_deps():
      + If there are no package dependencies, create an
        empty anonymous array reference to hold the (nonexistent)
        dependencies, required by filter_dependencies.
      + Make sure %entries is initialised.
    - fetch_source_files(): Check that the dsc specified is valid.
  * sbuild.conf: Don't require local config file.
  * sbuild.conf.local: Add $sbuild_mode, defaulting to "buildd".
  * example.sbuildrc: Add $build_dir example.
  * sbuild.1: Document --quiet.
  * sbuild-setup.5:
    - Split chroot setup and user setup into two sections.
    - Document sudoers env_keep setup (Closes: #355072, #355604).
  * Sbuild.pm: Remove unused module 'IO'.
  * chroot/add_sbuild_user: Add sudoers env_keep example.
  * debian/README.Debian: Document existence of sbuild-setup(7).
  * debian/control:
    - Depend on perl-modules (for File::Temp).
    - Recommend schroot 0.2.7 or later (for preserving the environment).
  * debian/dirs: Add etc/sbuild.
  * debian/rules:
    - Remove "make clean" in clean target; there is no Makefile, so this is
      redundant.
    - Install sbuild.conf as /usr/share/sbuild/sbuild.conf and
      sbuild.conf.local as /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf.
  * debian/preinst:
    - New conffile.
    - Remove /etc/sbuild.conf.local if not locally modified.
  * debian/postinst:
    - Move /etc/sbuild.conf.local to /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf if needed.
    - Reindent.
  * debian/postrm:
    - Unlink /etc/sbuild.conf if present.
    - Unlink files under /var/lib/sbuild.
    - Reindent.

sbuild (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - setup_options(): Set $main::chroot_apt_options in the same
      manner as upstream.
    - setup_options(): Correct usage of a scalar reference rather than
      the scalar $main::chroot_dir (Closes: #354520).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Feb 2006 19:07:59 +0000

sbuild (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - Fix typos in debug statement ($main::distribution rather than
      $main::distribtion, and $main::schroot_session rather than
      $main::scroot_session).  Thanks to Adeodato Simó for this fix
      (Closes: #354456).
    - get_schroot_info(): Parse schroot "--info" Path (chroot location)
      output.
    - get_schroot_info(): Parse schroot "--info" Type (chroot type)
      output, and if "plain", always set $main::dist_sessioncaps to 0
      ("plain" chroots may say they are session-managed, but do not
      support full session management, so they always need cleaning).
  * debian/control:
    - Recommend schroot (>= 0.2.5), for its "Path" information in --info
      output, used for determining the chroot location.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Feb 2006 22:19:04 +0000

sbuild (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - fetch_source_files(): Merge from upstream SVN (cset 94); Strip trailing
      whitespace from each line in $dscfile/debian/.sbuild-build-deps
      early on, making all subsequent regexes simpler.
    - Update copyright notice (add myself as a copyright holder).
    - Add %main::sessioncaps to store whether or not a chroot is
      session-capable.  Check the schroot "Session Managed" attribute to
      determine session capability.
    - If a chroot is session-capable, skip running uninstall_deps() (thanks
      to Reinhard Tartler).
    - Add debugging messages for distribution selection and schroot
      session creation (thanks to Reinhard Tartler).
  * debian/control:
    - Recommend schroot (>= 0.2.3-2), for its "Session Managed"
      information in --info output, used for skipping chroot cleanup.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Feb 2006 23:44:19 +0000

sbuild (0.38) experimental; urgency=low

  * Full sudo access is no longer mandatory when using the schroot
    chroot_mode (Closes: #287669, #331506).
  * schroot session management is now fully implemented and completely
    functional.
  * sbuild:
    - Move schroot metadata parsing to a separate function,
      get_schroot_info().  Parse both "Location" (for
      backwards-compatibility) and "Mount Location".
    - Move path and APT setup into a separate function, setup_options().
    - Remove check_dpkg_version().  This has not been necessary since the
      release of potato (Debian 2.2), which had a dpkg version 1.6.14.
    - When $chroot_mode == "schroot", clear %main::dist_order and
      %main::dist_locations using an empty array, rather than undef.
    - New functions get_command(), run_command(), get_apt_command() and
      run_apt_command() to run a command inside or outside the build
      chroot under the specified user, or run apt inside or outside the
      chroot (depending on the chroot_mode), respectively.
    - New function exec_command().  This is the same as run_command(), but
      runs the command with exec rather than system().
    - New functions log_command() to log a command being run,
      get_command_internal() and get_apt_command_internal() to get a
      command string without logging it; these are used by get_command(),
      run_command, exec_command(), get_apt_command() and run_apt_command(),
      which do log the command being run.  Commands are logged in for all
      chroot modes.
    - get_apt_command() and run_apt_command() take an additional parameter,
      the command to run (apt-get or apt-cache).
    - get_apt_command() and run_apt_command() take an additional parameter,
      the user to run as, because not all commands need (or should) run as
      root.
    - Use new commands for running commands inside and outside chroots:
      + Signing options for dpkg-buildpackage are double-quoted rather than
        single-quoted (because the main command is single-quoted).
      + All commands run in a pipeline are obtained with get_command() or
        get_apt_command().
      + All other commands are run with run_command(), exec_command() or
        run_apt_command().
      + check_space() only requires root access in the chroot.
    - Add schroot session management.  Sessions are created, run and
      removed automatically.  The current session is stored in
      $main::schroot_session.  setup_options is called once per build, in
      order to set up the session options.
    - Add missing newline to log message.
  * sbuild.1:
    - Update outdated information.
    - Correct macro usage and reindent.
    - Correct command-line summary (Closes: #311589).
  * sbuild-setup.7: New manpage.  This describes how to set up a chroot
    (Closes: #311363).
  * avg-pkg-build-time.1: Clean up.
  * update-sourcedeps.1: Clean up.
  * sbuild.conf: $schroot_options defaults to "-q" to match the built-in
    default.
  * example.sbuildrc: Single quote example email addresses in
    $maintainer_name, $uploader_name, and $key_id (Closes: #341327).
  * chroot/buildd.chroot:
    - Use "set -e" to abort on all errors (Closes: #342357).
    - Correctly quote all shell variables.
    - Use cdebootstrap rather than debootstrap.
  * chroot/buildd.chroot.pre-sarge: Remove.
  * chroot/README-buildd.chroot.pre-sarge: Remove (Closes: #308065).
  * debian/control:
    - Recommend schroot.
    - Recommend cdebootstrap rather than debootstrap.
  * debian/README.Debian: Update information about src-deps and schroot.

sbuild (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sync with upstream SVN:
    - avg-pkg-build-time, avg-pkg-build-time.1, sbuild, sbuild.1,
      update-sourcedeps, update-sourcedeps.1: Update copyright notices with
      current FSF postal address.
    - sbuild:
      + Split changes files sent in the log every 989 characters, to better
        conform to mail RFCs.
      + Always show versions of installed build dependencies.
      + Always purge packages when building in a chroot.
      + Output purged packages line by line, rather than all at once.
      + Use strftime() and getpwuid() instead of the external commands
        date and whoami.
      + Use /var/lib/sbuild/apt.conf if it exists, and create it if it does
        not.  This fixes the problem of the root filesystem
        /etc/apt/apt.conf and /etc/apt/apt.conf.d directories being used,
        while the copies in the chroot filesystem are ignored.
      + Allow arch: all packages to be built when $main::build_arch_all
        is true.
      + Hardware DEBIAN_FRONTEND to "noninteractive" when installing and
        purging packages.  "apt-get update" is also run when the package
        cache is out of date (closes: 331546).
      + Fix support for '~' in version numbers.
      + Add Sbuild.pm (upstream WannaBuild.pm), and replace version_cmp()
        with Sbuild::version_compare().
      + Add REDO support for binNMUs.
      + Add stats generation for download+install, build and remove times.
      + Disassociate from the controlling terminal and make stdin /dev/null
        for the dpkg-buildpackage process.
      + Don't create entries to the sbuild log when a package claims to
        build an _all.deb, but doesn't.  Instead, warn to the build log.
      + Delete binary-all packages that we didn't ask to be built.
      + By default, set APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated to "true".
      + Add $conf::chroot_only for compatibility with upstream
        (closes: #302628).
      + Add $conf::dpkg_source.
      + Add $conf::build_env_cmnd.
      + Merge whitespace and indentation changes.
      + Fix typos.
      + shutdown(): Don't close the package log if there is no current job.
      + read_build_essential(): Read build-essential from $main::chroot_dir
        instead of the root filesystem.
      + Add @main::toolchain_pkgs and @toolchain_regex.
      + check_space(): Redirect stderr of du to /dev/null.
      + run_apt(): Complete support for "install-deps-env".
      + Add --use-snapshot for building with gcc-snapshot.
      + build(): Remove dpkg-buildpackage debugging statements.
      + merge_pkg_build_deps(): Correctly separate dependencies in $deps,
        and don't immediately return if there are missing packages.
      + Remove support for --store-built-packages.
      + get_dpkg_status(): Check $version is set and compute $result in the
        same manner as upstream.
      + run_apt(): Remove '*' from $pkgs and $rpkgs.
      + install_deps(): purge packages with "dpkg --set-selections".
        schroot support added in addition to upstream changes.
      + fetch_source_files(): Support versioned fetches with apt-get.
      + Add support for auto_giveback_socket: add an extra argument to
        --auto-give-back and add an ssh '-S' option to analyze_fail_stage().
      + Support new --make-binNMU options.
      + Add support for $conf::chroot_only, and default to only running in
        a chroot for security and safety.
      + cleanup_close: Set $main::current_job to "" and shutdown if
        $main::HOME/EXIT-DAEMON-PLEASE exists and we are running in
        batchmode.
      + Move "Package claims to have built" error message to the same place
        as upstream.
    - sbuild.conf:
      + Remove watches.
      + Update alternatives (closes: #280689).
      + Comment out example %individual_stalled_pkg_timeout.
      + Empty @ignore_watches_no_build_deps.
    - sbuild.conf.local:
      + Add $chroot_only.
    - avg-pkg-build-space.1: Update text.
    - example.sbuildrc:
      + Remove $hack_changes_for_frozen.
      + Update comments.
  * sbuild.conf.local:
    - Use FHS-compliant pathnames, as in sbuild.conf.
  * Add support for building from experimental.
  * sbuild:
    - Parse the .changes rather than debian/files, so that the
      .dsc/.diff.gz/.orig.tar.gz are also copied back to ~/build.
    - Print information and contents of arch-all packages (closes: #321640).
  * debian/control: The maintainer field contains the list address.

sbuild (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  Roger Leigh:

  * debian/changelog: Convert to UTF-8.
  * sbuild:
    - Don't fail in the absence of central sourcedeps.  These are no longer
      required now source packages are required to have build dependencies,
      so this should not be fatal.
    - Added support for schroot:
      + Added $conf::chroot_mode.  This may be set to "split" (the
        historical default), or "schroot" (use schroot instead of sudo).
      + All operations using sudo now check the value of $chroot_mode, and
        use sudo or schroot accordingly.
      + When using schroot, %main::dist_order is filled using the schroot
        chroot priorities.
      + Added %main::dist_locations to store the location of the
        available chroots.
    - Print a readable error if a chroot does not exist.
  * debian/control: Update to Standards-Version 3.6.2.
  * debian/copyright: Use the new FSF address.
  * debian/conffiles: Remove.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use debhelper version 4 compatibility mode.
    - Move the find -maxdepth option to before non-option arguments, to
      fix find warnings.
    - Remove template comments.
    - avg-pkg-build-space symbolic link should be relative.

sbuild (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  Michael Banck:

  * bin/abort-current-build: Remove the `-B' from the grep line as
    `sbuild -s' does not pass that option to dpkg-configure and abort-
    current-build fails in that case.
  * sbuild: Set the locale to `POSIX' to make debconf and debhelper calls in
    the chroot not spew out locale warnings all the time.
    (closes: #287672)
  * sbuild: Removed check for specific distributions. Instead, fail if
    build/chroot-$dist is not there.
  * sbuild: Only override Distribution in .changes if specified as option on
    the command-line.
    (closes: #300145)
  * sbuild: Specify full path for Dir::Etc::main and Dir::Etc::parts.
  * example.sbuildrc: Clarify that $maintainer_name is not mandatory and
    overrides Maintainer: field, whereas $uploader_name overrides
    the Changed-By: field in changes.
  * Applied patch by Santiago Vila:
    - Moves scripts from /usr/lib/sbuild to /usr/share/sbuild and modifies
      all callers accordingly.
    - Add -n option to tail to comply with POSIX.
    - Call /usr/sbin/sendmail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail.
    (closes: #292717)

sbuild (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg --root isn't fixed so use ppack for the checkchroot
    script, recommend searchscripts instead of suggest
  * add a note to README.Debian and the man page that sbuild must be
    run in ~/build (or wherever the chroot-* symlink is) for sbuild

 -- Rick Younie <younie@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Sep 2002 19:38:16 -0700

  * added a note that the original tarball has to be in the sbuild work
    directory $CHROOT/build/<user> for an "sbuild --source" build
  * removed the old potato chroot description; it can be gotten from the
    woody version of the package if needed

sbuild (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

    differ now
  * unstable dpkg --root is broken currently so use ppack instead of
    dpkg for checkchroot
  * don't 'touch' downloaded source; in buildd context, buildd-watcher
    should use ctime not mtime to look for old files
  * add a blurb about using chrapt to finish off the chroot build, in
    case debootstrap doesn't quite get it right

 -- Rick Younie <younie@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Jul 2002 06:26:05 -0700

sbuild (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes #120309 (the ITP)
