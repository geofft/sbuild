sbuild (0.63.3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Thorsten Glaser ]
  * Apply patch from Arnaud Patard to fix the uploader (Closes: #636477).
  * Make sample configuration entries actually work (Closes: #696840).
  * Avoid using undef as HASH reference (Closes: #696841).

  [ Roger Leigh ]
  * New release.
  * buildd:
    - Remove duplicate stop action from init script (Closes: #695513).
    - Failure count before sleeping is configurable with
      MAX_SBUILD_FAILS (Closes: #693790).
  * sbuild:
    - Cross build-dependency installation failure throws an
      exception (Closes: #693788).
    - In Sbuild::ResolverBase, pass the correct options to deps_parse
      for cross-building and foo:native build dependencies
      (Closes: #697298).  Thanks to Colin Watson for this patch.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * sbuild:
    - Resolve cross-build-dependencies from package being built rather than
      from current apt sources (Closes: #695203).
  * buildd:
    - Reset sbuild failure count after sleeping.

  [ Adam Conrad ]
  * sbuild:
    - Improve cross chroot detection to look for $dist-$build-$host as a
      valid chroot for cross-build to avoid namespace clashes with native
      chroots, and document this better in the manpage (Closes: #695273)

  [ Geoffrey Thomas ]
  * sbuild:
    - When creating a changelog entry for binNMUs or
      --append-to-version, tag it with "binary-only=yes" so that
      dpkg-gencontrol uses the previous changelog entry for the source
      version (Closes: #672711, #681292).

sbuild (0.63.2-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix building packages with revision "0" (Closes: #687396)

sbuild (0.63.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Roger Leigh ]
  * New release.
  * Sbuild::Conf: Fix typo sucess (Closes: #663089).
  * Sbuild::Options:
    - Add --no-run-lintian and --no-run-piuparts options
      (Closes: #665372).  If lintian or piuparts are configured to run
      automatically following a successful build, there options disable
      this behaviour for the build.
    - Add --purge-build option (Closes: #629109).  This behaves
      identically to the old --purge option.  --purge now purges
      everything (build directory, build dependencies and schroot
      session) and is equivalent to using --purge-build, --purge-deps
      and --purge-session together.  Thanks to Jan-Marek Glogowski for
      this patch.
  * Sbuild::Conf:
    - Don't create the log directory unless logging is enabled or
      using buildd mode (Closes: #673009).
  * Sbuild::Build:
    - Don't pass $key_id to the shell unescaped (Closes: #676475).
    - Use _all.changes rather than _arch.changes if -A is passed to
      dpkg-buildpackage (Closes: #674669).  Thanks to Daniel Dehennin
      for this patch.
  * Sbuild::Utility: Fix logging in download function (Closes: #637931).
  * sbuild:
    - If running sbuild from inside a build tree (like
      dpkg-buildpackage), place the build logs outside the tree
      (Closes: #676834).  Logs will be created in '..' rather than '.'.
    - When packing source trees with "dpkg-source -b", always pass
      "." as the directory to pack, so the orig.tar can be found
      (Closes: #662785).
  * sbuild-createchroot:
    - Use profile=sbuild in place of script-config= in generated
      schroot.conf configuration (Closes: #665215, #675861).
    - Don't pass --keyring to dpkg-buildpackage unless explicitly set
      by the user (Closes: #673676).

sbuild (0.63.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Roger Leigh ]
  * New release.
  * Don't require xapt.  Remove duplicate and incorrect check.  Thanks
    to Andres Mejia and Jakub Wilk (Closes: #675332, #675354).
  * Remove /etc/schroot/setup.d/99builddsourceslist which was
    provided with earlier versions of sbuild, but no longer works with
    current schroot versions (Closes: #675349).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Thu, 31 May 2012 21:59:16 +0100

sbuild (0.63.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Wookey ]
  * Support for cross-compiling has been added.  This includes the
    addition of $host and $build configuration variables, with
    corresponding --host and --build command-line options.  This
    includes the addition of a new 'xapt' dependency resolver.
    - Merge cross-build support (thanks to Hector Oron,
      Closes: #610689).
    - Add multiarch cross-build support.

  [ Roger Leigh ]
  * The deprecated 'internal' dependency resolver has been removed,
    along with the configuration variables $apt_policy,
    $check_depends_algorithm and $resolve_virtual, and the
    command-line option --check-depends-algorithm.  The 'apt'
    resolver is the default replacement for 'internal'.
    (Closes: #622788)
  * Support for watches has been removed.  The configuration
    variables $check_watches, $ignore_watches_no_build_deps and
    $watches (and obsolete variables @ignore_watches_no_build_deps
    and %watches) have also been removed.
  * sbuild-stats and support for build time and space statistics
    recording has been removed.  These statistics are recorded in
    both the build log and are available as build metadata
    internally.  The statistics recorded in the database were not
    particularly informative; storing the statistics in a proper
    relational database is recommended.  The configuration variables
    $avg_time_db and $avg_space_db have been removed.
  * Drop 25nssdatabases schroot setup script used on compatibility
    mode (on buildds).  This has been replaced by the schroot
    20nssdatabases for many years.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Wed, 30 May 2012 22:49:18 +0100

sbuild (0.62.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * All changes backported from buildd-0.61.0 branch.
  * sbuild.1: Add --chroot to synopsis (Closes: #635203).
  * sbuild:
    - --jobs is an alias for -j, to match documented behaviour
      (Closes: #635250).
    - The use of alternatives in Build-Depends and Build-Depends-Indep
      may be turned on or off by the configuration variable
      $resolve_alternatives.  It may also be enabled or disabled at
      build time using the --resolve-alternatives and
      --no-resolve-alternatives options, respectively.
    - Correctly support chroot namespaces, to work with schroot 1.5.x
      (Closes: #612630).
    - Support Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Conflicts-Arch fields in
      debian/control.  These may be manually set with
      --add-depends-arch and --add-conflicts-arch, respectively.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Wed, 07 Dec 2011 20:41:43 +0000

sbuild (0.62.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - Correct use of Dpkg::Version for version parsing, to ensure
      correct behaviour when using native package versions and epochs.
    - Don't require an exact version when building a package directly
      from a source tree.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Jul 2011 19:56:05 +0100

sbuild (0.62.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - Failing lintian checks are highlighted in red, and passes in
      green (Closes: #631060).
    - The distribution in the build summary is coloured yellow if it
      does not match the distribution in the changelog.  This is to
      indicate that there may be a potential problem, such as
      potentially uploading a package intended for experimental to
      unstable by building for unstable by accident.
    - lintian test results are also coloured to highlight success and
      failure.
    - Log colouring may now be disabled using $log_colour.
    - sbuild only permits building one source package at once.
      Previously sbuild would allow building of more than one package
      in a single invocation.  Making this change means that the exit
      status will always be the status of the build rather than the
      last build, and it also means the logging is simplified and may
      be started earlier.
    - Now that the main log has been removed, and packing of a source
      tree takes place before starting the build for real, we no longer
      create a log file in the build tree, confusing "dpkg-source -b"
      (Closes: #612324).
    - Added new directory /var/lib/sbuild/build to hold build trees for
      sbuild when building.  This will be bind mounted on /build inside
      the chroot following an update to the schroot sbuild and buildd
      fstab configuration for schroot.  This saves significant amounts
      of space when using LVM snapshot chroots, and it also makes it
      easier to preserve build trees for failing builds when using
      snapshots.
    - Extra environment variables to be set when running
      dpkg-buildpackage may now be set using $build_environment
      (Closes: #631595).  These variables will supplement the existing
      environment (e.g. PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH), and will not be subject
      to filtering with $environment_filter.
    - Existing hard-coded .dsc/.changes/dpkg-parsechangelog parsing has
      been replaced with use of Dpkg::Control.  Existing reimplmentation
      of the dpkg version comparison and regexes to split versions into
      epoch/version/revision have been replaced with use of
      Dpkg::Version.
  * sbuild-adduser: Use current sbuild-update options in example
    (Closes: #630791).

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Jun 2011 11:39:44 +0100

sbuild (0.62.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - The apt and internal resolvers will resolve some alternatives
      even when resolving alternative dependencies is disabled
      (Closes: #622832).  For relations involving the same package,
      the alternative will be permitted when the package names are
      the same for each alternative.  For example,
        foo (<< x) | foo (>= y) | bar
      will be reduced to
        foo (<< x) | foo (>= y)
      while
        foo | bar
      will be reduced to
        foo
    - The sbuild-schroot wrapper program has been removed; sbuild is
      now an arch-all package again.
    - Move lock directory to /var/lib/sbuild/chroot-lock, rather than
      using /var/lock/sbuild which could be a symlink to /run/lock on
      the host (Closes: #626826).  This means parallel builds won't
      block due to sharing the same lockfile.
    - Remove schroot buildd profile.  This will now be provided by
      the schroot package itself directly.  This requires schroot
      1.4.22 or greater.
    - Add lintian and piuparts results to build summary
      (Closes: #617450).
    - Remove directory correctly in postrm (Closes: #627641).  Thanks
      to Daniel Baumann.
    - Lock sbuild account on purge, and unlock on install
      (Closes: #619892).
    - Add -j option to run parallel builds (Closes: #626357).
    - Log build environment prior to starting a build.  This will be
      useful in diagnosing problems with a misconfigured chroot, such
      as missing HOME which can lead to misbuilds.
  * sbuild-createchroot:
    - Don't call ChrootSetup::basesetup after initial bootstrap; wait
      until actually running sbuild.  The users and groups used for
      chown don't exist at this point, leading to (harmless) failure.
      Closes: #622735.
    - Don't overwrite existing symlinks under /etc/sbuild/chroot
      (Closes: #608416).
  * sbuild-update:
    - Don't try to end the current chroot session if a signal is
      received and no session is in progress (Closes: #629005).
  * buildd:
    - init script starts buildd in runlevels 2-5 rather than S, and
      stops in 0, 1 and 6.
    - Lock buildd account on purge, and unlock on install.
  * buildd-mail:
    - Remove empty newline from .changes (Closes: #627854).
      ftp-master started refusing .changes files which have a trailing
      empty line (after the GPG end of signature).  It happens that
      mutt introduces one when signing GPG in traditional mode.  Other
      tools probably do too.  buildd-mail-wrapper should probably drop
      it automatically.  Thanks to Samuel Thibault.

sbuild (0.62.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - New options --no-apt-clean, --no-apt-update, --no-apt-upgrade and
      --no-apt-distupgrade have been added to allow these actions to be
      disabled even when set as the default in the configuration.
    - root is not required to be a member of the sbuild group in order
      to run schroot via the sbuild-schroot wrapper
      (Closes: #619128, #619002).
    - Don't require HOME to be set in the environment (Closes: #619288).
    - Work around broken build-essential on Ubuntu Lucid
      (Closes: #619526).  Thanks to Marc Deslauriers.
    - --keep-session is replaced by
      --purge-session=(always|successful|never).  This will allow the
      session to be purged for all, successful and no builds,
      respectively (Closes: #619332).
    - sources.list fragments stored in /etc/apt/sources.list.d have
      0644 permissions, so that normal users can run apt-cache in the
      chroot during a build (Closes: #620797).  Thanks to Julian Andres
      Klode for identifying this problem.
    - Log filtering may be disabled using $log_filter = 0 in the
      configuration (Closes: #620589).  The replacement text is now
      also surrounded with "«" and "»" so that strings such as CHROOT
      and BUILDDIR can't be confused with any actual appearance of the
      same string in the build log.
    - Log colouring may be disabled using $log_colour = 0 in the
      configuration.
    - Improve binNMU handling to permit binNMUs for multiarch packages
      (Closes: #620112).  Currently, binary NMUs use the current date
      in the new changelog entry, but co-installable packages require
      an identical changelog.  To avoid this, take the date from the
      previous changelog entry to ensure the same date for all binNMUs.
      Thanks to Anders Kaseorg for this patch.
    - Abort early if maintainer is not defined when performing a binNMU
      or appending a version suffix (Closes: #620758).
  * sbuild.conf:
    - Don't set a default value for $build_dir (Closes: #619416).
      This value is set each run, and so varies between builds when
      generating the configuration file.  Exclude from the generated
      output to prevent unnecessary differences between builds.
    - $purge_session uses the same purge modes as $purge_build_deps and
      $purge_build_directory, rather than a boolean value.
  * buildd:
    - Merge latest changes from buildd-0.61.0.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Tue, 05 Apr 2011 10:46:49 +0100

sbuild (0.62.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New release.
  * Fixed security issue in the sbuild-schroot wrapper program which
    did not enforce sbuild group membership in order to allow users
    to access the chroots as user sbuild.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Mar 2011 23:06:52 +0000

sbuild (0.62.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depend upon libexception-class-perl.
  * sbuild:
    - Resolvers:
      + 'apt' is now the default build dependency resolver.  Users should
        not see any significant changes compared with the old 'internal'
        resolver.  Please note that you may need to generate a GPG key
        for the local archive created for dependency package
        installation, if one does not already exist; see sbuild-update
        (--keygen) for further details.
      + The 'internal' build dependency resolver is deprecated.  It is
        not recommended for future use, and will be removed once it is no
        longer used by the buildd infrastructure.  Please use the 'apt'
        resolver as a drop-in replacement.
      + The 'aptitude' build dependency resolver will, unlike 'apt' and
        'internal', consider alternative dependencies by default, rather
        than only using the first alternative.  This is intended to both
        preserve backward compatibility, and make the 'aptitude'
        resolver the preferred choice for more complex situations, such
        as building for experimental.
      + The aptitude resolver can resolve complex dependencies, e.g.
        A | B, where A is uninstallable now correctly falls back to B.
        This is not the case for the internal or apt resolvers, which by
        intent do not make use of alternatives (they use the first
        alternative only.  sbuild now has full support for resolving
        alternatives, but this is not the default behaviour
        (Closes: #403246).  Please see #614807 for a proposed description
        of autobuilder-imposed build dependency restrictions in Policy.
      + All build dependency resolvers run dpkg with --force-confold.
        This means packages with modified conffiles in the chroot to not
        cause build failure.  This includes /etc/services and
        /etc/protocols from netbase (Closes: #576508).
    - Logging:
      + Long paths such as the chroot location and the build directory
        inside the chroot are now filtered in the build log and replaced
        with small, constant, abbreviations (Closes: #605763).  This makes
        the build logs comparable between builds with tools such as
        diff(1).
      + Logging messages have been improved, and important messages are
        now coloured when running interactively (does not affect log
        files).  Errors, warnings and informational messages are coloured
        red, yellow and green, respectively.  Build status is coloured
        green for success and red for all failure conditions.
      + Build log mails are now compressed and mailed in MIME format by
        default, together with a copy of the .changes file.  The old
        behaviour (plain mailing of uncompressed logs) may be restored by
        setting $mime_build_log_mails=0 in the configuration, and
        compression may also be disabled in the MIME mails by setting
        $compress_build_log_mails=0.  Note that it is no longer possible
        to send compressed log mails unless MIME mailing is enabled.
        Thanks to Philipp Kern for implementing this.
    - Error handling:
      + In order to handle errors more robustly, the build code now has
        initial support for exception handling.  Normal operation will
        not be affected, but fatal errors may be logged in a different
        order than seen previously.  Fatal errors will now be seen at the
        end of the build log, which should make it easier to spot
        problems.
      + sbuild now always cleans up fully when receiving a termination
        signal such as SIGINT or SIGTERM.  Note that you may need to wait
        while the cleanup actions are performed, or the current task is
        completed prior to initiating cleanup.  When running
        interactively, hitting Ctrl-C will sent SIGINT to the entire
        process group; doing this while apt-get or aptitude are running
        will potentially leave dpkg in an inconsistent state, so aborting
        at this point is not recommended.  Sending a SIGTERM to the
        sbuild process will always work cleanly.
    - General:
      + sbuild now performs an apt dist-upgrade at the start of each
        build by default, rather than an upgrade.  This is to reduce the
        amount of manual administration required to keep chroots up to
        date, and is not much more risky than upgrade in this context.
      + A new option, --keep-session, has been added (Closes: #609658).
        This prevents the automatic removal of session-managed snapshot
        chroots.  Previously, snapshots would not be deleted if purging
        of the build directory or build dependencies was disabled, but
        this was not always desirable, hence it is now configurable
        separately.
      + Internally, building and other actions in the chroot are
        performed by the 'sbuild' system user, where previously the user
        invoking sbuild would be used instead.  The aim of this change is
        to separate privileges to increase security and reduce the chance
        of accidental or deliberate tampering of the build environment.
        While the latter is not addressed by these changes, this will be
        taken care of during future architectural changes.
      + The sbuild package build directory created inside the chroot now
        has a reduced name length.  It's now /build/packagename-XXXXXX
        where XXXXXX are random characters.  This helps reduce the chance
        of hitting path length restrictions on some architectures,
        particularly when using sockets.
  * wanna-build:
    - The wanna-build database has been removed entirely.  This part of
      the sbuild package was not used, and was not maintained for some
      time.  Users wishing to use wanna-build should investigate the
      version in the wanna-build.git repository used by the Debian
      autobuilding infrastructure.  This version is actively maintained
      and in continual use.
  * sbuild.conf:
    - sbuild.conf is now automatically generated from the help text and
      defaults in the source code.  This means that the examples will
      always be syntactically correct, the help text will always be
      current, and the defaults will always match the defaults in the
      source code (Closes: #609932, #610995).
    - Non-scalar (or reference) types are deprecated in sbuild.conf.
      This is because it is not possible to tell the difference between
      an empty and an undefined value.  Values using array or hash
      types should use the equivalent array reference or hash
      reference, which have been supported for some time.  The old
      style array and hash values will remain supported for now, but
      will be removed in a future release.
  * buildd.conf:
    - Automatically generated like sbuild.conf.  As for sbuild.conf,
      non-scalar types are deprecated.
  * sbuild.conf.5:
    - All of the allowed values in sbuild.conf are now documented in a
      new sbuild.conf(5) manual page.  Like sbuild.conf, this is
      entirely generated from the source code, so will always match the
      defaults for the same sbuild version.
  * buildd.conf.5:
    - New manual page.  Like sbuild.conf(5), this documents all allowed
      values.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Mar 2011 16:10:31 +0000

sbuild (0.61.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - The apt and aptitude build dependency resolvers now use only the
      first alternative in alternative dependencies.  The other
      alternatives are stripped out entirely.  This makes the apt and
      aptitude resolvers behave exactly like the internal resolver.
      Note that this is configurable with the $resolve_alternatives
      option, so alternative resolving may be re-enabled with this
      option if desired.  This is useful for e.g. backports, but not
      for unstable where the strict consistency and reproducibility
      offered by only using the first alternative is required.
    - The aptitude resolver now runs dpkg with --force-confold, to
      match the behaviour of internal and apt.  This prevents failure
      when installing netbase into the build chroot, for example.

sbuild (0.60.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - Don't automatically generate local archive signing key if
      missing (Closes: #607945).  If missing, abort build with an error
      message and instructions for how to generate the key.
    - Do not filter out environment variables starting with DEBIAN_ by
      default (Closes: #608659).  Thanks to Modestas Vainius.
    - Do not filter out PATH environment variable (Closes: #610997).
      Note this is not the user's PATH, but the $path in sbuild.conf.
    - Aptitude resolver defines a custom SolutionCost in order to
      improve resolver behaviour (Closes: #608789).  Thanks to
      Modestas Vainius.
    - When running apt-get, use "-o APT::Install-Recommends=false"
      rather than "--no-install-recommends" in order to support older
      releases (Closes: #609811).  Thanks to Marc Deslauriers.
    - Purging the package removes generated files in /etc/sbuild/chroot
      and /var/lib/sbuild (Closes: #608412).
    - The architecture specified with --arch (defaulting to the host
      system architecture) must match the chroot architecture
      (Closes: #609151).  This was previously allowed to be superceded
      by the chroot architecture.  This change is to avoid any abiguity
      regarding the host/build architecture for the package being built.
    - Add --no-arch-all option to force not building arch-all packages
      (Closes: #613401).  Thanks to Sebastian Harl for this patch.
  * sbuild-createchroot:
    - Use less restrictive permissions on chroot directory and schroot
      configuration file (Closes: #608414).  The chroot now has 0755
      permissions, and the schroot configuration 0644.
    - Don't require sudo access (Closes: #608429).  The
      Sbuild::ChrootPlain module used to run commands inside the newly-
      created chroot was using sudo to run commands when already
      running as root.  sudo is no longer used when root.
    - Remove use statement which prevented command-line options being
      registered (Closes: #610007, #607606).  Command-line options now
      work correctly.
  * sbuild.conf:
    - $environment filter is syntactically correct (Closes: #610997).
      Thanks to Jakub Wilk.
    - $apt_allow_unauthenticated is documented to use apt-secure(8)
      (Closes: #608971).
  * sbuild.1:
    - Document the temporary local archive used by the apt and aptitude
      build dependency resolvers to store and install dummy dependency
      packages (Closes: #608972).

sbuild (0.60.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - Don't use user's default GPG configuration and keyrings for
      signing archives; use sbuild archive signing keys only
      (Closes: #606668).  Thanks to Simon McVittie for this patch.
    - Use an empty directory as GPG homedir.
    - Don't run "apt-get update" to update local archive; copy files
      directly into /var/lib/apt/lists.  This means the remote mirror
      lists can't be updated during a build, and it also saves the
      time needed to update the lists an additional two times.

sbuild (0.60.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

sbuild (0.60.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Roger Leigh ]
  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - sbuild now sanitises its environment when running external
      commands.
    - sbuild no longer generates the files REDO and SBUILD-REDO-DUMPED.
    - sbuild now has a testsuite.
    - apt and aptitude build-dependency resolvers now use a local apt
      archive, which improves the behaviour of the apt resolver (the
      dependency package will no longer be removed in some situations).
    - Workaround uninstallable sysvinit on Ubuntu, where sysvinit is
      still present in the build-essential package list.  Thanks to
      Jamie Strandboge.
  * sbuild-update:
    - sbuild-update works on multiple chroots (Closes: #604715).
    - sbuild-update works with multiple architectures (Closes: #606001).
      Thanks to Ansgar Burchardt for this patch.
    - sbuild-update now has a --keygen option to generate signing keys
      for temporary apt archives.
  * sbuild.1: Update description of --maintainer (Closes: #605745).
    Thanks to Jakub Wilk.
  * Sbuild::ConfBase: Only use MAILTO_HASH if defined (Closes: #589615).
    Thanks to Marc Dequènes for this patch.

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * sbuild:
    - Do not skip purging of build directory if chroot is cloned
      (Closes: #605997).  This is necessary if /build in chroots is
      (bind-)mounted to the outside of the session.  However, if /build
      is part of the cloned session, $purge_build_directory='never'
      could be used in order to avoid wasting time when the session
      ends.

    time being.

  * sbuild-createchroot:
    - Allow direct creation of tarballs from chroots, with various
      options for compression (Closes: #545215).  Thanks to Andres
      Mejia.
  * sbuild-update:
    - sbuild-clean functionality has been merged into sbuild-update.
      Thanks to Andres Mejia.
  * sbuild:
    - Dependency resolving:
      . 'aptitude' is now the default dependency resolver.  Users
        wishing to use the old resolver should set
        $build_dep_resolver='internal' in their configuration.
      . The aptitude resolver can resolve complex dependencies.
        A | B, where A is uninstallable now correctly falls back to B
        (Closes: #403246).
      . Removal of Build-Conflicts now works, due to using apt-get
        or aptitude to perform the removal (Closes: #464376).
      . Default to not enabling virtual dependency resolving with the
        internal resolver ($resolve_virtual=0).  This is to avoid
        changing the historical behaviour by default.
    - Don't set Sbuild::debug_level to undef (Closes: #602318).
      Thanks to Andres Mejia.
    - Add debuild-like feature to run sbuild on an unpacked source
      tree (Closes: #551311).  In addition to specifying a package
      version to build, or a source package .dsc, a directory may be
      used.  This will be packaged with 'dpkg-source -b' prior to
      building.  Thanks to Andres Mejia.
    - Add support for running lintian after a build.  Thanks to Andres
      Mejia.
    - Add support for running external commands before and after a
      build, and during chroot setup and cleanup.  These may be used
      to run piuparts, for example.  Thanks to Andres Mejia.
  * Run sbuild-* chroot maintenance commands in the 'source' chroot
    namespace for chroots providing such a facility (Closes: #567505).
    This means that update/distupgrade etc. operations will occur in
    the source volume for lvm-snapshot and btrfs-snapshot chroot types.
    Note that the sbuild chroot lock (/var/lock/sbuild) may be copied
    into cloned chroots if a build is started during a maintenance
    operation and the build will block until the operation is completed.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Mon, 08 Nov 2010 17:07:40 +0000

sbuild (0.60.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * sbuild:
    - Dependency resolving:
      . The aptitude build dependency resolver now sets
        Aptitude::CmdLine::Ignore-Trust-Violations based upon the
        $apt_allow_unauthenticated option (Closes: #588035).  Thanks to
        Ansgar Burchardt for this patch.
      . Improve handling of alternative build dependencies and Provides
        using the interal build dependency resolver.  (Closes: #586275,
        #578810, #591187, #591188, #591189, #595863, #595866, #595872).
        Thanks to Ansgar Burchardt for this patch.
      . Remove virtual build-dependency resolving using the "internal"
        resolver using the static ALTERATIVES (%alternatives) list.  This
        was already limited, non-functional, and is obsoleted by the
        "aptitude" resolver.
      . Added the ability to resolve virtual dependencies using the
        "internal" build dependency resolver by calling "apt-cache
        --names-only" to get candidate packages to satisfy the
        dependency.  The first package (sorted alphabetically) is
        chosen (Closes: #595934).  This may be disabled using the
        $resolve_virtual option.
      . Use apt-get to remove build conflicts using the internal
        resolver and correctly reinstall post build.
    - Log the package source version as well as binary version in the
      package build log, since these may differ when making binNMUs
      (Closes: #569823).
    - Always attempt to install ESSENTIAL (build-essential) packages
      if they aren't already installed (Closes: #380113).
    - Don't end session on build failure (Closes: #567506).  This allows
      examination of build trees and cloned chroots on build failure,
      rather than unconditionally deleting them, which prevents this.
      Thanks to Jan-Marek Glogowski.
    - Remove support for parsing output of apt-get stderr
      (Closes: #571806).
    - Check for sbuild group membership using gid and supplementary
      groups (Closes: #599350).
  * buildd:
    - Read entire contents of pipes (Closes: #567821).  Thanks to
      Samuel Thibault.  This ensures receipt of complete log
      messages.
    - Replace/Breaks with ubuntu-dev-tools <= 0.83 (Closes: #590153).
      Thanks to Lorenzo De Liso.
  * buildd-vlog: Fix breakage (Closes: #567822).  Thanks to
    Samuel Thibault.  This fix introduces sleeps, and is not a
    complete or entirely optimal fix, but corrects the existing
    breakage.
  * Documentation:
    - Remove trailing 'q' from sbuild-createchroot(8) manual page
      (Closes: #579971).  Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso.
    - sbuild(1):
      . Remove and rewrite obsolete parts of the manpage
        (Closes: #599348).
      . .sbuildrc is no longer required for sbuild to function
        (Closes: #598054).

    - Hint aptitude to produce better solutions in AptitudeBuildDepSatisfier.
      Thanks to Modestas Vainius.  (Closes: #570463)
    - AptitudeBuildDepSatisfier: Handle the case when default negative dep is
      not available gracefully.  Thanks to Modestas Vainius.
      (Closes: #571565).
    - Improve support for aptitude.
    - Set DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive when using aptitude
      (Closes: #588818).
    - Improve dpkg-source v3 source format handling.  Don't hard-code
      assumptions about how the source files are named
      (Closes: #559533).
    - Remove conflict with schroot from oldstable.
  * buildd:
    - Retry the current suite if --take fails.  (Closes: #570463)
  * buildd-uploader:
    - Don't remove the uploader lock if not already the owner
      Closes: #591620).  Thanks to Sebastian Andrzej Siewior.
  * libsbuild-perl:
    - depend on schroot 1.4.0 or greater due to sbuild-createchroot
      creating schroot.conf fragments with 1.4.x-specific features.

sbuild (0.60.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.8.4.
    - Use ${misc:Depends} as required by debhelper.
  * sbuild:
    - Only run "schroot --info" once on startup, to speed up the startup
      time when many chroots exist (Closes: #546624).  Thanks to
      Nelson Elhage for finding this issue and suggesting a suitable
      approach for fixing it.
    - Don't append binNMU or extra version to version number for use
      in the DSC filename (Closes: #546647).  Thanks to Nelson Elhage
      for finding this issue.
    - Distinguish between failed/attempted builds (Closes: #538083).
    - Build directory cleaned under all failure conditions
      (Closes: #538085).
    - Flush stdout explicitly in logger to avoid "choppy" output when
      monitoring interactively.  Autoflushing stdout appears to be
      broken in Perl 5.10 so flush explicitly in addition to
      enabling autoflush.  Thanks to Ryan Niebur for spotting this.
    - Print a list of all installed packages and versions, in addition
      to toolchain packages (Closes: #553301).  Thanks to Felipe
      Sateler for this suggestion.
    - Don't default distribution to unstable (Closes: #559659).
      Defaulting to unstable can result in unintentional uploads of
      packages targetted at other distributions, such as experimental,
      which can potentially cause serious breakage.  As a result, it is
      safer to require manually specifying the distribution, or
      explicitly setting it in the configuration file.
    - Set the man-db man-db/auto-update parameter to false to disable
      unnecessary work in a build environment.
    - Don't give back packages failing the arch check (Closes: #561936).
      Thanks to Philipp Kern for reporting this.
    - Add command-line and configuration options to enable running
      apt-get clean, upgrade and dist-upgrade prior to building.  These
      complement the existing option to update the chroot, which is now
      also fixed (Closes: #521096).
    - Add $build_source variable to sbuild.conf to complement the
      --source command-line options (Closes: #564528).  Thanks to
      David Bremner for this suggestion.
    - Allow setting of $build_dir in sbuild.conf (Closes: #535911).
      Thanks to Andres Mejia for this patch.
    - Add $check_space option to allow free space checking to be
      disabled (Closes: #551917).  Thanks to Bruno Kleinert for this
      suggestion.
    - --apt-update both updates and upgrades the chroot
      (Closes: #521096).  Thanks to Gustavo Noronha Silva for this
      patch.  Note the original bug report 'get_apt_command' error
      was fixed on the 17th March 2009.
    - Allow the use of -C as well as --check-depends-algorithm as
      documented (Closes: #546673).  Thanks to Nelson Elhage for this
      patch.
  * Add sbuild-clean script (Closes: #551310).  Thanks to Andres Mejia
    for this patch.
  * sbuild-createchroot:  Compute an absolute path for the chroot
    location.  Thanks to Cyril Brulebois for this patch.
  * wanna-build:
    - Depend on postgresql-8.4-debversion in place of
      postgresql-8.3-debversion (Closes: #559607).  Thanks to Martin Pitt
      for reporting this.
    - wanna-build now reads its system configuration from the correct
      location (/etc/buildd/wanna-build.conf, not
      /etc/wanna-build/wanna-build.conf).
    - Remove extra parenthesis from wanna-build-merge-packages
      (Closes: #553364).  Thanks to Felipe Sateler for this patch.
  * Remove absent -t option for --top from sbuild-stats.1
    (Closes: #566320).  Thanks to Kurt Roeckx.
  * buildd:
    - Don't bind-mount /home into the schroot. (Closes: #566315)

    - Fix NO_WARN_PATTERN default to not warn about sbuilds build/current-*
      symlinks. (Closes: #566722)
    - Do all w-b interaction, leave nothing of it to sbuild. (Closes: #567646,

  * Restore buildd package.
  * Split common library functions into new libsbuild-perl package.
  * debian/sbuild.(preinst|postinst|postrm):
    - Remove special cases for versions older than oldstable.  Update
      addition and removal of sbuild group to use return value of getent
      rather than parsing getent output.
    - Use addgroup/delgroup in place of adduser/deluser.
    - Use --system when adding and deleting group, to ensure creation

sbuild (0.57.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * Sbuild::Build::new: Check if 'DSC' exists rather than 'DSC File' to allow
    the .dsc to be in any directory (Closes: #489794).  Thanks to
    Francois-Denis Gonthier for this patch.
  * $Sbuild::Conf::apt_allow_unauthenticated: New configuration parameter
    to disable APT package authentication, which is now enabled by default
    (Closes: #492327).  Thanks to Enrico Zini for this patch.
  * Sbuild::Options: Use isin from Sbuild.pm (Closes: #492577).
  * Sbuild::Log: Add version number and correctly-formatted date to the
    package log name instead of a raw time_t (Closes: #493150).
    Additionally add user and architecture to the name.

    Thanks to Marc Fargas.
  * Package name, version, build directory and associated information are
    now contained within Sbuild::Build objects.  This allows stripping of
    epoch to construct correct unpack directory location
    (Closes: #482931, #482922).
  * Warnings due to uninitialised variables are no longer reproducible
    (Closes: #449251).

    chroot prior to fetching sources and building (Closes: #472350).
    Thanks to Timothy G Abbott for this patch.
  * Add --chroot option to specify a chroot separately from the
    distribution name (Closes: #474160).  Thanks to Simon McVittie for
    this patch.

  * debian/control:
    - Depend upon schroot >= 1.1.6.  This version includes a

      and hence package removal may be skipped.
    - Add wanna-build package.
  * debian/rules: set libexecdir to /usr/share, for compatibility with
    locations of scripts in earlier versions.
  * debian/sbuild.install: use /usr/share in place of /usr/lib

sbuild (0.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild
    - Fix --force-orig-source option which was renamed to
      --force_orig_source while rewriting the options parsing logic to use
      Getopt::Long (Closes: #428205).  Thanks to Alec Berryman for
      reporting this regression.

 -- Roger Leigh <rleigh@debian.org>  Sat, 07 Jul 2007 20:36:35 +0100

sbuild (0.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - Parse options with Getopt::Long.
    - Remove trailing whitespace.
    - Initialise $main::sub_task with a value, in case the build gets
      terminated prior to it being used.
    - Change the position of begin_session, so that it matches the cleanup
      order on shutdown.
    - build:
      + Document the regex which strips the epoch from the version
        number.
      + Remove the call to setsid when forking dpkg-buildpackage, because
        this broke shell job control.  Some packages might possibly hang
        while building if they detect they have a controlling terminal, but
        IMO this is a bug in the package.
      + When handling the timeout for dpkg-buildpackage, make the $SIG{'ALRM'}
        handler local, so that it is restored to the default once the build
        has finished.
      + When calling mv to move files, use -f to make sure it doesn't run
        interactively.
    - check_dependencies: If a toolchain package is missing, print a
      "not installed" message, rather than a blank version.
    - dsc_md5sums: Log failure to open the .dsc.
    - fetch_source_files: Strip the epoch of the version number, so that
      $dscbase matches the .dsc filename in the filesystem (Closes: #425715).
      Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum.
    - merge_pkg_build_deps: Replace references to "central" src deps with
      build-essential deps.
    - parse_manual_srcdeps: New function, to replace the addition of manual
      source dependencies from the removed read_deps() function.
    - shutdown: Call end_session to clean up the chroot.
  * Sbuild/Chroot.pm:
    - end_session:
      + Add a debugging message.
      + Clear $schroot_session.
  * Sbuild/Conf.pm: Add linux-libc-dev, gnumach-dev, hurd-dev and
    kfreebsd-kernel-headers to @toolchain_regex.  Thanks to Clint Adams
    (Closes: #425855).
  * Sbuild/Log.pm.in:
    - Remove trailing whitespace.
    - open_log, open_pkg_log: Ignore SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM and SIGPIPE
      in the logger processes, so that logging continues if the process
      group is signalled to terminate.  They will exit when the group leader
      exits or closes the pipe.
  * debian/changelog: Fix missing colon in bug closure for revision 0.2.4.
  * debian/compat: New file.  Set to debhelper compatibility level 5.
  * debian/control: Depend on debhelper v5.
  * debian/NEWS: Renamed from debian/NEWS.Debian (Closes: #425370).
    Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum for spotting this.
  * debian/rules: Remove DH_COMPAT.

      Martin Koeppe (Closes: #418061).

      + Remove obsolete code for running dpkg-buildpackage outside a chroot.
    - fetch_source_files:
      + Remove support for building from a directory.
      + Download sources directly into the chroot build directory.  For
        sources already existing outside the chroot, copy them into the

      and pass this to begin_session (Closes: 410576).

    mode), and aborts with instructions for correctly configuring sudo.
    This prevents apt-get silently using the configuration from the host
    system instead of the chroot.
  * Sbuild/Chroot.pm: When running in split mode, use the -s option of
    su to set the shell used inside the chroot to /bin/sh.  This
    ensures that a valid shell is always used when the $SHELL is not
    available inside the chroot (Closes: 378283).
  * sbuild.conf, sbuild.conf.local, update-sourcedeps, sbuild.1.in,
    avg-pkg-build-time.1.in: Update to use the new configuration file
    locations.

  * Sbuild/Chroot.pm: Use su, rather than sudo, inside the chroot.  This
    prevents the APT_CONFIG and DEBCONF_FRONTEND environment variables
    from being removed (Closes: #376020).
  * Sbuild/Conf.pm: Add $Sbuild::Conf::su.
  * sbuild-setup.7.in: Remove sudo configuration inside the chroot, now
    this is no longer required.

sbuild (0.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * bin/checkchroot: Correct uninitialised value warnings due to using an
    undefined variable (Closes: #369709).
  * bin/chrapt, bin/updatechroot, bin/upgradechroot: When chroot_mode is
    "schroot", chdir to / to ensure the CWD exists inside the chroot.
    Thanks for Clint Adams for finding this (Closes: #372806).
  * sbuild: fetch_source_files: When running apt-cache, check if we got
    valid output, and warn appropriately if the output is invalid
    (Closes: #369707).  Output may be invalid if there are no deb-src
    lines in /etc/apt/sources.list in the chroot.
  * Sbuild/Conf.pm: Remove $Sbuild::Conf::log_dir checks.
  * Sbuild/Log.pm.in: If $Sbuild::Conf::log_dir does not exist, try to
    create it, and if this fails, warn and log to stdout
    (Closes: #369718).

  * sbuild:
    - fetch_source_files: Only print "apt-get update" invocation in debug
      mode.
    - get_dpkg_status: Make sure $version is defined before checking its
      value, to ensure the Debian version can have a value of 0.  Thanks
      to Santiago Vila for this fix (Closes: #368066).
  * Update svn::ignore properties to ignore generated files.
  * debian/control:
    - Update to Standards-Version 3.7.2.
    - Use Build-Depends, rather than Build-Depends-Indep.

  * bin/checkchroot:
    - Check if the dpkg and reference files contained any data, and exit
      with an error if either were empty (Closes: #363351).
    - On error, use Sbuild::Utility::shutdown to clean up.
  * bin/chr-hold, bin/chr-unhold: On error, use Sbuild::Utility::shutdown
    to clean up.
  * sbuild:
    - build: Only print dpkg-buildpackage invocation in debug mode.
    - uninstall_debs: Only print dpkg invocation in debug mode.
  * debian/control: Update to Standards-Version 3.7.0.

sbuild (0.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * avg-pkg-build-time: Use Sbuild::Conf.
  * bin/checkchroot: Convert to Perl, using Sbuild::Utility.
  * bin/chrapt: Convert to Perl, using Sbuild::Utility.
  * bin/chr-hold: Convert to Perl, using Sbuild::Utility.
  * bin/chr-unhold: Convert to Perl, using Sbuild::Utility.
  * bin/gochroot: Convert to Perl, using Sbuild::Utility.
  * bin/updatechroot:
    - Convert to Perl, using Sbuild::Utility.
    - chrapt is no longer used (Closes: #355035).
    - Sbuild::Chroot is used for chroot access:
      + Suite names are no longer hardcoded (Closes: #355037).
      + APT Options are set correctly (Closes: #355038).
  * bin/upgradechroot: Convert to Perl, using Sbuild::Utility.
  * bin/common_functions: Remove; this is no longer used.
  * sbuild:
    - Treat schroot chroots with a "-sbuild" suffix in the same way as
      chroots without a suffix (Closes: #360124).
    - Use the new modules Sbuild::Chroot, Sbuild::Conf and Sbuild::Log.
      The functions moved into the modules have been removed.
    - Import needed module functions into the local namespace, to avoid
      long namespace prefixes on functions.
    - Remove $main::chroot_apt_options.
    - Move $main::debug to Sbuild::Conf.
    - Import Sbuild::Conf into package "conf".  This allows the package
      name used by upstream to be used for backward compatibility.
    - Use $conf::HOME instead of $main::HOME.
    - Move $main::username to Sbuild::Conf.
    - Set $main::chroot_dir, $main::chroot_build_dir,
      $main::srcdep_lock_dir and $main::ilock_file from the current
      chroot $Sbuild::Chroot::current.  $main::srcdep_lock_dir replaces
      $conf::srcdep_lock_dir (which is still used to set when the chroot
      is set up).
    - Pass $main::distribution to open_log and open_pkg_log.
    - Remove $main::cwd, $main::nolog and $main::verbose, now provided by
      Sbuild::Conf.  They are imported from Sbuild::Conf for backward
      compatibility.
    - Remove unused $main::HOSTNAME.
    - Add build statistics to close_pkg_log.
    - Die if no maintainer_name, uploader_name or key_id is specified.
    - Set and unset $main::binNMU_name in the main loop, rather than when
      opening and closing the package log.  In consequence, open_pkg_log
      now needs the package name only, and close_pkg_log does not need
      the package name passing.
    - build:
      + Set $firstline to "" to quell a warning.
      + Use debian_files_list to check for missing or extra packages, and
        warn appropriately.
      + Delete erroneous _all.deb files (Closes: #357042).
    - Don't use File::Temp (only needed by modules).
    - Remove build directory check.
    - Use File::Basename::basename instead of Sbuild::basename.
    - Don't import internal Sbuild::Chroot functions.
    - Split verify_dsc_md5sums into two parts: dsc_md5sums and
      verify_md5sums.
    - debian_files_list: New function to parse debian/files.
  * Sbuild/Chroot.pm:
    - New perl module for chroot operations.  It contains the functions
      begin_session, end_session, log_command, get_command_internal,
      get_command, run_command, exec_command, get_apt_command_internal,
      get_apt_command and run_apt_command.
    - Don't export init and log_command.
    - Don't hardcode a list of chroots; use a glob to search for chroot-*
      instead.  This allows any distribution name to be specified with -d.
    - Add an "APT Options" attribute to the chroot hash, to replace
      $main::chroot_apt_options.
    - Use STDERR instead of PLOG (which may not be available).
    - Replace $main::debug with $Sbuild::Conf::debug.
    - Replace $main::username with $Sbuild::Conf::username.
    - begin_session takes the distribution as its first argument, rather
      than using $main::distribution.
    - Don't use $main::chroot_dir.  Add the build paths as 'Build Location',
      'Srcdep Lock Dir' and 'Install Lock' to the chroot metadata.
    - Use File::Temp.
    - Don't export "internal" functions.
    - _setup_options: Set "APT Options" for schroot chroots.
    - log_command: Don't substitute CHROOT_APT_OPTIONS when no APT options
      are in use.
  * Sbuild/Conf.pm:
    - New perl module for configuration variables.  It reads the system
      and user configuration.
    - Add $debug.
    - Add $username.
    - Add $cwd, $nolog and $verbose.  They exported and used by the other
      modules in place of the variables in the main package.
    - Add and export $avg_time_db, $avg_space_db, $maintainer_name,
      $uploader_name and $key_id.
    - Add build directory check (moved from sbuild).
  * Sbuild/Log.pm:
    - New perl module for logging.  It contains the functions open_log,
      close_log, open_pkg_log, close_pkg_log, add_time_entry,
      add_space_entry, send_mail and log_symlink.
    - $main::main_logfile and $main::pkg_logfile are package variables.
    - Removed use of $main::distribution.  The distribution name must be
      passed to open_log or open_pkg_log.
    - Don't use $main::HOSTNAME or $main::arch.  Get the values directly.
    - open_pkg_log: Save the package name for future use; the binNMU name
      (if any) is passed, so this no longer needs computing.
    - close_pkg_log:
      + Obtain $main::pkg_status, $main::pkg_start_time,
        $main::pkg_end_time and $main::this_space from the function
        arguments.
      + Don't pass the package name, which was saved in open_pkg_log.
    - add_space_entry: Use $space rather than $t, and don't use
      $main::this_space.
    - Use File::Temp.
    - Use File::Basename::basename instead of Sbuild::basename.
  * Sbuild/Utility.pm: New perl module for utility programs.  This is a
    perl replacement for bin/common_functions.
  * bin/checkchroot:
    - Quote all variables.
    - Sort ref-chroot file before diffing (Closes: 360058).
  * avg-pkg-build-time.1.in, sbuild.1.in, sbuild-setup.7.in,
    update-sourcedeps.1.in, Sbuild/Log.pm.in: Rename and embed version and
    date tags for substitution.
  * COPYING: New file (GPL licence text).
  * debian/control: Update uploaders.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Update with new subversion repository locations for upstream and
      Debian.
    - Add Roger Leigh as a copyright holder.
    - Add a reference to /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL.
  * debian/dirs: Add usr/share/perl5/Sbuild.
  * debian/rules:
    - Install Sbuild/Chroot.pm, Sbuild/Conf.pm, Sbuild/Log.pm and
      Sbuild/Utility.pm into /usr/share/perl5/Sbuild.
    - Generate all manual pages and Log.pm in the build rule, and remove
      them in the clean rule.

sbuild (0.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - verify_dsc_md5sums(): New function to verify the MD5SUM of files in a
      .dsc file.
    - Add $conf::md5sum for security.
    - fetch_source_files():
      + Use verify_dsc_md5sums to check for incomplete downloads, and
        redownload sources if needed; also verify again after download
        (Closes: #270439).
      + Remove redundant braces and reindent.
    - build(), shutdown(): Quote kill command correctly (Closes: #356686).
    - When using schroot, look for a distribution named
      "$distribution-sbuild" in preference to "$distribution".
    - open_log(), open_pkg_log():
      + Use fork() rather than tee to multiplex log output.
      + Don't buffer log output (Closes: #358717).
    - close_log(), close_pkg_log(): Close all dup'd log streams, and don't
      kill the child log processes, which avoids dataloss in the pipeline.
    - log_symlink(): New function to create a symbolic link to the current
      package log.  This replaces the use of /bin/ln, which has races if
      concurrent builds use it.
    - open_log(), close_log():
      + Save a references to the initial STDOUT and STDERR, and restore
        them when the log is closed.
      + Create the build log using File::Temp, in the form
        build-distribution-date.XXXXXX.log.  This prevents races during
        logfile creation when running concurrent builds.  If the file
        is empty, it is unlinked on close, irrespective of whether
        verbose mode is used or not.
    - open_pkg_log(): Use the saved STDOUT for verbose logging.  This
      prevents the package log being also directed to the build log.
    - setup_options(): Remove unused call to tmpnam().
    - check_dependencies(): Print kernel information along with the
      toolchain package versions, in the same style as reportbug.
    - build(): Check for _all.udeb files which are built when they
      shouldn't (merge from upstream SVN cset 98).
    - Strip "./" from $pkg, so the name used for source dependencies is
      correct (Closes: #359747).
    - Add --force-orig-source option to force the inclusion of the
      .orig.tar.gz (Closes: #318030).
    - Add $conf::force_orig_source to allow --force-orig-source to be
      specified in a .sbuildrc.
  * sbuild.1:
    + Document schroot chroot naming.
    + Document --force-orig-source option.
    + Correctly escape hyphens in option and file names.
  * sbuild-setup.7: Use debootstrap rather than cdebootstrap.
  * bin/common_functions: Allow any chroot name to be specified
    (Closes: #356785).
  * bin/README.bins: Document changed chroot syntax.
  * bin/checkchroot: Set LC_COLLATE=POSIX to prevent collation issues
    (mismatches with the reference file; Closes: #294883).
  * bin/common_functions, bin/README.bins: Remove ~/build/ from the
    chroot path, to match sbuild behaviour of searching in the
    current directory (Closes: #355034).
  * chroot/README-buildd.chroot: Fix typo.
  * chroot/buildd.chroot: Use debootstrap rather than cdebootstrap
    (Closes: #358668).
  * debian/control: Recommend debootstrap rather than cdebootstrap.
  * example.sbuildrc: Add example $force_orig_source, with documentation.

sbuild (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - get_apt_command_internal(): Always add $main::chroot_apt_options.
    - log_command(): Add an additional priority argument.  If nonzero,
      the message is always logged, otherwise is only logged if debug is
      enabled.
    - get_command_internal(): When running schroot, preserve the user
      environment, needed for APT_CONFIG, DEBIAN_FRONTEND, etc..
    - get_command(), run_command(), exec_command(), get_apt_command(),
      run_apt_command():
      + chdir to $main::cwd to make sure the directory location also exists
        inside the chroot.
      + Add an additional priority argument to control the urgency of the
        log message, and pass this to log_command().
    - get_virtuals(): Remove usage of $main::chroot_apt_options, which is
      added automatically by get_apt_command().
    - get_command(), run_command() and exec_command() only log the full
      command when debugging is enabled, otherwise only the short form is
      logged (Closes: #355043).
    - setup_options():
      + Ensure APT_CONFIG is set to the correct path depending upon the
        chroot_mode.  $chroot_aptconf is the absolute path to the file from
        the host system, while $aptconf is the absolute path when apt is
        run.
      + Only set $main::chroot_apt_options when chroot_mode is "split".
      + Always regenerate apt.conf, because when chroot_mode is changed, it
        will break APT unless rewritten.
      + Don't set "Dir" in $chroot_aptconf when in chroot_mode is "schroot"
        (because apt is run inside the chroot).
    - Remove setpgrp() calls, so that all child processes run in the same
      process group as the parent.
    - Add a $conf::sbuild_mode, used to switch behaviour between user and
      buildd defaults.  The default is "buildd".  This allows package build
      errors to be reported (Closes: #170742).
    - Add a --quiet option, the opposite action to --verbose.
    - open_pkg_log():
      + Use correct Sbuild:: namespace for binNMU_version (Closes: #355861).
      + Create current-distribution symlink in addition to current.
    - Set the in the environment SHELL=/bin/sh, in case the user
      invoking sbuild uses a shell not available inside the chroot.
    - Remove unused variables @dist_parts and $main::nomail.
    - Use correct use syntax for File::Temp and Cwd, and initialise a
      number of variables which would otherwise be undefined, in order
      to remove run-time warnings.
    - Add a number of checks for undefined variables to remove run-time
      warnings.
    - Add -w to the shebang line, so sbuild always runs with warnings
      enabled.
    - All exec commands other than writing logfiles now use exec_command,
      so they get logged.
    - Require /usr/share/sbuild/sbuild.conf and optionally require
      /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf.
    - Use named signals, rather than numbers, for portability.
    - close_log(), close_pkg_log: If verbose is enabled, flush the log and
      wait a second before killing tee, to prevent data loss in the pipeline.
    - $main::verbose is set by default if running on a tty (Closes: #355802).
    - LOG and PLOG are set to autoflush using IO::Handle.
    - $conf::build_dir defaults to $main::cwd if undefined.  It is used as
      the directory containing the build chroots, build logs, and current
      symlinks (Closes: #183022).
    - Always print toolchain packages.  This is done by always calling
      merge_pkg_build_deps(), and running all the way through
      install_deps(), even when the package does not supply any build
      dependencies or conflicts (Closes: #355040).
    - install_deps():
      + If there are no package dependencies, create an
        empty anonymous array reference to hold the (nonexistent)
        dependencies, required by filter_dependencies.
      + Make sure %entries is initialised.
    - fetch_source_files(): Check that the dsc specified is valid.
  * sbuild.conf: Don't require local config file.
  * sbuild.conf.local: Add $sbuild_mode, defaulting to "buildd".
  * example.sbuildrc: Add $build_dir example.
  * sbuild.1: Document --quiet.
  * sbuild-setup.5:
    - Split chroot setup and user setup into two sections.
    - Document sudoers env_keep setup (Closes: #355072, #355604).
  * Sbuild.pm: Remove unused module 'IO'.
  * chroot/add_sbuild_user: Add sudoers env_keep example.
  * debian/README.Debian: Document existence of sbuild-setup(7).
  * debian/control:
    - Depend on perl-modules (for File::Temp).
    - Recommend schroot 0.2.7 or later (for preserving the environment).
  * debian/dirs: Add etc/sbuild.
  * debian/rules:
    - Remove "make clean" in clean target; there is no Makefile, so this is
      redundant.
    - Install sbuild.conf as /usr/share/sbuild/sbuild.conf and
      sbuild.conf.local as /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf.
  * debian/preinst:
    - New conffile.
    - Remove /etc/sbuild.conf.local if not locally modified.
  * debian/postinst:
    - Move /etc/sbuild.conf.local to /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf if needed.
    - Reindent.
  * debian/postrm:
    - Unlink /etc/sbuild.conf if present.
    - Unlink files under /var/lib/sbuild.
    - Reindent.

  * sbuild:
    - setup_options(): Set $main::chroot_apt_options in the same

    - setup_options(): Correct usage of a scalar reference rather than
      the scalar $main::chroot_dir (Closes: #354520).

sbuild (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - Fix typos in debug statement ($main::distribution rather than
      $main::distribtion, and $main::schroot_session rather than
      $main::scroot_session).  Thanks to Adeodato Simó for this fix
      (Closes: #354456).
    - get_schroot_info(): Parse schroot "--info" Path (chroot location)
      output.
    - get_schroot_info(): Parse schroot "--info" Type (chroot type)
      output, and if "plain", always set $main::dist_sessioncaps to 0
      ("plain" chroots may say they are session-managed, but do not
      support full session management, so they always need cleaning).
  * debian/control:
    - Recommend schroot (>= 0.2.5), for its "Path" information in --info
      output, used for determining the chroot location.

sbuild (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild:
    - fetch_source_files(): Merge from upstream SVN (cset 94); Strip trailing
      whitespace from each line in $dscfile/debian/.sbuild-build-deps
      early on, making all subsequent regexes simpler.
    - Update copyright notice (add myself as a copyright holder).
    - Add %main::sessioncaps to store whether or not a chroot is
      session-capable.  Check the schroot "Session Managed" attribute to
      determine session capability.
    - If a chroot is session-capable, skip running uninstall_deps() (thanks
      to Reinhard Tartler).
    - Add debugging messages for distribution selection and schroot
      session creation (thanks to Reinhard Tartler).
  * debian/control:
    - Recommend schroot (>= 0.2.3-2), for its "Session Managed"
      information in --info output, used for skipping chroot cleanup.

sbuild (0.38) experimental; urgency=low

  * Full sudo access is no longer mandatory when using the schroot
    chroot_mode (Closes: #287669, #331506).
  * schroot session management is now fully implemented and completely
    functional.
  * sbuild:
    - Move schroot metadata parsing to a separate function,
      get_schroot_info().  Parse both "Location" (for
      backwards-compatibility) and "Mount Location".
    - Move path and APT setup into a separate function, setup_options().
    - Remove check_dpkg_version().  This has not been necessary since the
      release of potato (Debian 2.2), which had a dpkg version 1.6.14.
    - When $chroot_mode == "schroot", clear %main::dist_order and
      %main::dist_locations using an empty array, rather than undef.
    - New functions get_command(), run_command(), get_apt_command() and
      run_apt_command() to run a command inside or outside the build
      chroot under the specified user, or run apt inside or outside the
      chroot (depending on the chroot_mode), respectively.
    - New function exec_command().  This is the same as run_command(), but
      runs the command with exec rather than system().
    - New functions log_command() to log a command being run,
      get_command_internal() and get_apt_command_internal() to get a
      command string without logging it; these are used by get_command(),
      run_command, exec_command(), get_apt_command() and run_apt_command(),
      which do log the command being run.  Commands are logged in for all
      chroot modes.
    - get_apt_command() and run_apt_command() take an additional parameter,
      the command to run (apt-get or apt-cache).
    - get_apt_command() and run_apt_command() take an additional parameter,
      the user to run as, because not all commands need (or should) run as
      root.
    - Use new commands for running commands inside and outside chroots:
      + Signing options for dpkg-buildpackage are double-quoted rather than
        single-quoted (because the main command is single-quoted).
      + All commands run in a pipeline are obtained with get_command() or
        get_apt_command().
      + All other commands are run with run_command(), exec_command() or
        run_apt_command().
      + check_space() only requires root access in the chroot.
    - Add schroot session management.  Sessions are created, run and
      removed automatically.  The current session is stored in
      $main::schroot_session.  setup_options is called once per build, in
      order to set up the session options.
    - Add missing newline to log message.
  * sbuild.1:
    - Update outdated information.
    - Correct macro usage and reindent.
    - Correct command-line summary (Closes: #311589).
  * sbuild-setup.7: New manpage.  This describes how to set up a chroot
    (Closes: #311363).
  * avg-pkg-build-time.1: Clean up.
  * update-sourcedeps.1: Clean up.
  * sbuild.conf: $schroot_options defaults to "-q" to match the built-in
    default.
  * example.sbuildrc: Single quote example email addresses in
    $maintainer_name, $uploader_name, and $key_id (Closes: #341327).
  * chroot/buildd.chroot:
    - Use "set -e" to abort on all errors (Closes: #342357).
    - Correctly quote all shell variables.
    - Use cdebootstrap rather than debootstrap.
  * chroot/buildd.chroot.pre-sarge: Remove.
  * chroot/README-buildd.chroot.pre-sarge: Remove (Closes: #308065).
  * debian/control:
    - Recommend schroot.
    - Recommend cdebootstrap rather than debootstrap.
  * debian/README.Debian: Update information about src-deps and schroot.

sbuild (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sync with upstream SVN:
    - avg-pkg-build-time, avg-pkg-build-time.1, sbuild, sbuild.1,
      update-sourcedeps, update-sourcedeps.1: Update copyright notices with
      current FSF postal address.
    - sbuild:
      + Split changes files sent in the log every 989 characters, to better
        conform to mail RFCs.
      + Always show versions of installed build dependencies.
      + Always purge packages when building in a chroot.
      + Output purged packages line by line, rather than all at once.
      + Use strftime() and getpwuid() instead of the external commands
        date and whoami.
      + Use /var/lib/sbuild/apt.conf if it exists, and create it if it does
        not.  This fixes the problem of the root filesystem
        /etc/apt/apt.conf and /etc/apt/apt.conf.d directories being used,
        while the copies in the chroot filesystem are ignored.
      + Allow arch: all packages to be built when $main::build_arch_all
        is true.
      + Hardware DEBIAN_FRONTEND to "noninteractive" when installing and
        purging packages.  "apt-get update" is also run when the package
        cache is out of date (closes: 331546).
      + Fix support for '~' in version numbers.
      + Add Sbuild.pm (upstream WannaBuild.pm), and replace version_cmp()
        with Sbuild::version_compare().
      + Add REDO support for binNMUs.
      + Add stats generation for download+install, build and remove times.
      + Disassociate from the controlling terminal and make stdin /dev/null
        for the dpkg-buildpackage process.
      + Don't create entries to the sbuild log when a package claims to
        build an _all.deb, but doesn't.  Instead, warn to the build log.
      + Delete binary-all packages that we didn't ask to be built.
      + By default, set APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated to "true".
      + Add $conf::chroot_only for compatibility with upstream
        (closes: #302628).
      + Add $conf::dpkg_source.
      + Add $conf::build_env_cmnd.
      + Merge whitespace and indentation changes.
      + Fix typos.
      + shutdown(): Don't close the package log if there is no current job.
      + read_build_essential(): Read build-essential from $main::chroot_dir
        instead of the root filesystem.
      + Add @main::toolchain_pkgs and @toolchain_regex.
      + check_space(): Redirect stderr of du to /dev/null.
      + run_apt(): Complete support for "install-deps-env".
      + Add --use-snapshot for building with gcc-snapshot.
      + build(): Remove dpkg-buildpackage debugging statements.
      + merge_pkg_build_deps(): Correctly separate dependencies in $deps,
        and don't immediately return if there are missing packages.
      + Remove support for --store-built-packages.
      + get_dpkg_status(): Check $version is set and compute $result in the
        same manner as upstream.
      + run_apt(): Remove '*' from $pkgs and $rpkgs.
      + install_deps(): purge packages with "dpkg --set-selections".
        schroot support added in addition to upstream changes.
      + fetch_source_files(): Support versioned fetches with apt-get.
      + Add support for auto_giveback_socket: add an extra argument to
        --auto-give-back and add an ssh '-S' option to analyze_fail_stage().
      + Support new --make-binNMU options.
      + Add support for $conf::chroot_only, and default to only running in
        a chroot for security and safety.
      + cleanup_close: Set $main::current_job to "" and shutdown if
        $main::HOME/EXIT-DAEMON-PLEASE exists and we are running in
        batchmode.
      + Move "Package claims to have built" error message to the same place
        as upstream.
    - sbuild.conf:
      + Remove watches.
      + Update alternatives (closes: #280689).
      + Comment out example %individual_stalled_pkg_timeout.
      + Empty @ignore_watches_no_build_deps.
    - sbuild.conf.local:
      + Add $chroot_only.
    - avg-pkg-build-space.1: Update text.
    - example.sbuildrc:
      + Remove $hack_changes_for_frozen.
      + Update comments.
  * sbuild.conf.local:
    - Use FHS-compliant pathnames, as in sbuild.conf.
  * Add support for building from experimental.
  * sbuild:
    - Parse the .changes rather than debian/files, so that the
      .dsc/.diff.gz/.orig.tar.gz are also copied back to ~/build.
    - Print information and contents of arch-all packages (closes: #321640).
  * debian/control: The maintainer field contains the list address.

sbuild (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  Roger Leigh:

  * debian/changelog: Convert to UTF-8.
  * sbuild:
    - Don't fail in the absence of central sourcedeps.  These are no longer
      required now source packages are required to have build dependencies,
      so this should not be fatal.
    - Added support for schroot:
      + Added $conf::chroot_mode.  This may be set to "split" (the
        historical default), or "schroot" (use schroot instead of sudo).
      + All operations using sudo now check the value of $chroot_mode, and
        use sudo or schroot accordingly.
      + When using schroot, %main::dist_order is filled using the schroot
        chroot priorities.
      + Added %main::dist_locations to store the location of the
        available chroots.
    - Print a readable error if a chroot does not exist.
  * debian/control: Update to Standards-Version 3.6.2.
  * debian/copyright: Use the new FSF address.
  * debian/conffiles: Remove.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use debhelper version 4 compatibility mode.
    - Move the find -maxdepth option to before non-option arguments, to
      fix find warnings.
    - Remove template comments.
    - avg-pkg-build-space symbolic link should be relative.

sbuild (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  Michael Banck:

  * bin/abort-current-build: Remove the `-B' from the grep line as
    `sbuild -s' does not pass that option to dpkg-configure and abort-
    current-build fails in that case.
  * sbuild: Set the locale to `POSIX' to make debconf and debhelper calls in
    the chroot not spew out locale warnings all the time.
    (closes: #287672)
  * sbuild: Removed check for specific distributions. Instead, fail if
    build/chroot-$dist is not there.
  * sbuild: Only override Distribution in .changes if specified as option on
    the command-line.
    (closes: #300145)
  * sbuild: Specify full path for Dir::Etc::main and Dir::Etc::parts.
  * example.sbuildrc: Clarify that $maintainer_name is not mandatory and
    overrides Maintainer: field, whereas $uploader_name overrides
    the Changed-By: field in changes.
  * Applied patch by Santiago Vila:
    - Moves scripts from /usr/lib/sbuild to /usr/share/sbuild and modifies
      all callers accordingly.
    - Add -n option to tail to comply with POSIX.
    - Call /usr/sbin/sendmail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail.
    (closes: #292717)
  * sbuild: Tolerate '0' as version number, thanks Santiago Vila.
