	over the sbuild segfault on mips and arm in gdb.

2006-02-13  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* save some backtracking.  Thanks to bod@d.o

2006-01-30  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* add DEBIAN_FRONTEND to sudoers example defaults

2006-01-30  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* As buildd-uploader now calls dupload with a single changes file,
	any error return from dupload most likely means that the job
	failed, so we treat it as such.

2006-01-30  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Add comments of the needed sudoers entries, including Defaults
	entry needed for the stable security update

2006-01-08  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Fix to delete symlinks, too

2006-01-08  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	files.

2006-01-08  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	related entries.

2005-12-02  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* remove Binary-NMU fields when a Dep-Wait'd package has a new
	sourceful version uploaded.

2005-11-29  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Fix Revision output to just have the revision

	* Forget binNMU info when a new source comes along.

	* Warn on packages that are in state Installed, but the version
	installed is less than the source version in w-b.

	* If a package is in state Installed, but it doesn't have binaries
	from the current source version in parse_quinn, also move to
	Needs-Build.

2005-11-28  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* watch for EOF from STDIN when reading failure messages

	* update the source version if it's less than the packages in
	parse_packages (fixing the "why does that buildd build what was
	uploaded with the source?"  problem)

2005-11-23  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Fix duplicate copy of binNMU_version function for new versioning

2005-11-15  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* (sbuild): Delete binary-all packages that we didn't ask to be
	built.

	* (buildd): specify a username when asking what's to be built
	(needs new wanna-build)

	* (wanna-build): store last seen timestamp for each buildd

	* update changelog version

2005-11-15  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Include more setup commands.  Lay out chroot's by codename, for
	future auto suite-switching code (hopefully for etch release)

2005-11-15  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* change defaults for security to use security-master

2005-11-15  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* move parse_date here from wanna-build binary.

	* change binNMU numbering to be {sourceversion}+b{binNMUnumber}

2005-11-04  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* add pwd infront of target if not specified, so the fstab entries
	will always work

2005-10-13  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix typo of database name

2005-10-12  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix already building binNMU error message output what database
	w-b is running on when run with -v on the version line

2005-10-11  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Add regex for failure to connect to the ssh socket for newer
	openssh versions

2005-10-11  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Add optional admin_users array that lists which users are
	allowed to use overall database admin commands such as --merge-*,
	--import, and --manual-edit

	* Ensure to-be registered binNMU version is newer than the
	currently installed version.

2005-10-03  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Fix broken pkg_version_eq calls

2005-10-02  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* (wanna-build): add support for storing binary NMUs in the
	wanna-build db with --binNMU=# where # is the binNMU number to
	create.  You will be asked for the changelog entry if not
	specified with -m.  The Version field of the database entry will
	always track the source version from the sources files now, rather
	than the Packages files.  Version numbers for binNMUs can be
	specified as either the source version, or the full binNMU version
	number.

	* (buildd): add support for taking binNMUs from wanna-build,
	passing them to sbuild, and adding them to REDO.  Older buildds
	will delete binNMU redo lines from the redo file as being invalid,
	and will take binNMUs, but not attempt to build them.  BinNMUs are
	scheduled ahead of regular builds, and are always taken
	one-at-a-time, like weak_no_autobuild.  binNMUs show in the
	logfile as !#!pkg_ver, where # is the binNMU version number.

	* (sbuild): Add REDO support for binNMUs.  binNMU packages will
	only appear in the progress file as their binNMU version number
	while actually building, so buildd-vlog continues to work.
	Otherwise, it will be the source version.

	* (buildd-uploader): Large rewrite to work better for buildds with
	slow or intermittent links.  The logfile is no longer locked the
	whole time buildd-uploader runs, so mail can still be processed.
	Each package is uploaded in a seperate dupload process, and
	wanna-build state updated right after the upload is successful.
	This also has the effect that one stalled upload will not prevent
	attempts at uploading the other packages.  Ensure that no more
	than one buildd-uploader can run at once; previously, after 15
	minutes, buildd-uploader would run anyways, possibly uploading
	duplicates.  Take distribution field from changes files, rather
	than requiring the distribution field to be in a hardcoded list.

	* (buildd): removed stats generation for build time.

	* (sbuild): add stats generation for download+install, build, and
	remove times.

	* (buildd-watcher): output new time stats.  These won't be fully
	accurate from when one upgrades until the next stats generation,
	after which, they should reflect the full stats time period (one
	week by default)

	* (debian/control): update dependencies to indicate that buildd
	and sbuild need the latest versions of each other, due to the REDO
	format change and time stats changes.

	* (sbuild): disassociate from the controlling terminal and make
	stdin /dev/null for the dpkg-buildpackage process.  buildd already
	does this, but you didn't get that when run from the command line.

	* (sbuild): don't create entries to the sbuild log when a package
	claims to build an _all.deb, but doesn't.  Instead, warn to the
	build log.

	* (sbuild): workaround race condition while apt-ftparchive is
	running on the archive host.  The signed Release file doesn't
	match what is downloaded, so current apt deletes the list.  These
	cases are now given-back, rather than failed.

	* (abort-current-build): use a sudo'd perl to kill the
	dpkg-buildpackage process, incase sudo is being used by sbuild

	* (buildd): report errors while waiting for sbuild, and don't keep
	waiting for it if there are no children at all.

	* (sbuild.conf): default watch list to empty, most buildds run
	with clean chroots

	* (sbuild.conf): update alternatives, remove some ancient ones
	that aren't used anymore

	* (wanna-build): remove db entries that don't have any binary
	packages in the Packages files anymore.  If something is added to
	P-a-s, and the binaries removed, it was still showing as
	"installed" with the last built version.

	* (setup_system): add additional commented out adduser command for
	when you already have a buildd group

	* (setup_system): update chroot build command I:

	* (buildd-make-chroot): create /etc/hosts file in chroot

	* (buildd-make-chroot): Update debootstrap call to work with
	modern debootstrap that pull Build-Essential from the packages
	files.

	* (buildd-make-chroot): support etch

	* (many): Update FSF address again.

2005-08-22  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* add missing $change++ in parse_quinn so that changes will
	actually be committed.

2005-08-22  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* really fix --uploaded with current buildd-uploader arbitrary
	priorities can be specified for a package.  It will apply to the
	current package for Needs-Build, Building, and Uploaded.  It will
	apply to the next version of the package for Failed and Dep-Wait.
	The priority will be reverted after that build.  There is also a
	permanent priority setting, to change the default that the package
	will be returned to.

2005-08-20  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* ensure --uploaded works with existing buildd-uploaders and
	epochs

2005-08-19  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* AutoDepWait V1.  Catches the package (>= version) and (>>
	version) cases.  Only applies to packages just moved to
	Needs-Build by the quinn merge, so there is a way to get out from
	behind them, if they are wrong for whatever reason.

	* split WB version compare functions to seperate perl module use
	them from sbuild instead of forking dpkg for each comparison
	further MLDBM optimizations and fixes

2005-08-05  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix small error in dupload strings update

2005-07-19  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* more removal of non-US.

	* also check the security upload dir for deletions in one more
	place

2005-07-19  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* update dupload error strings for modern dupload

2005-07-15  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* parameters weren't being passed to pretend_avail()

2005-07-13  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Treat "-" in quinn-diff priority fields as "unknown", rather
	than "-"

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Ensure a hash exists before a reference is passed to
	change_state, or the state change won't be recorded.

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* disable strict refs for now

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Patch from Brendan O'Dea <bod@debian.org> for version
	comparisons to support ~ correctly.

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* And the big efficiency rewrite required by MLDBM.  It actually
	works now :)

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix strftime calls

	* add --merge-all option to take exactly one of Packages,
	quinn-diff, and Sources.  Import them all, then clean the db.
	Saves multiple opens of the database for daily maintenance.

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* use strftime instead of `date`, don't set a default arch (only
	used for parsing packages, which should always be specified), and
	only call hostname if we actually send mail.

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* switch to Storable for MLDBM, as this is faster than the default
	of Data::Dumper.

2005-07-10  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	Replace wanna-build's WrapDB class with MLDBM, resulting in a 3x
	speed improvement on database accesses.  This change requires you
	to first --export your database with the old version, and then
	--import with the new one.

2005-07-06  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Fix ~ support in versions.

2005-07-06  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* set DEBIAN_FRONTEND to noninteractive when purging packages,
	too.

2005-07-06  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* commented out example of chroot_only option

2005-07-06  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* add chroot_only mode, where sbuild will die if it's not building
	inside a chroot, rather than using the root

2005-07-06  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix buildd-watcher to correctly report old files in chroots,
	too.

2005-07-06  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* update $no_warn_pattern for ssh socket.

2005-06-06  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* don't bother creating upload-non-US anymore

2005-06-02  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Update version

2005-06-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* sync with newraff, pointed out by Lamont.

2005-06-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* From Lamont: allow arch: all packages to be built when
	$main::build_arch_all is true.

2005-06-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Make sbuild more resilient about cruft in the status file
	(again), without undoing the provides and real package at the same
	time fix.

2005-06-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix typo in fallback code

2005-06-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* use /var/debbuild/apt.conf if it exists.  If it doesn't exist,
	try to create it with the Dir ""; directive for the chroot.  If it
	can't be created, use the existing logic.  This fixes the problem
	of the root's /etc/apt/apt.conf and /etc/apt/apt.conf.d
	directories being used, while the chroot's are ignored.

2005-06-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* make it "work"

2005-05-28  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

2005-05-05  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* update version

2005-05-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* remove use of external utilities where we already have functions
	imported that do the same thing

2005-05-01  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* install buildd-make-chroot in /usr/sbin, rather than /usr/bin

2005-04-28  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* check EXIT-DAEMON-PLEASE in check_restart() instead of at the
	top of mainloop.

2005-04-25  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix for versioned depends with both provided and actual package
	installed; The versioned depends should always happen off the
	actual package.

2005-04-21  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* include buildd-make-chroot in the sbuild package

2005-03-26  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* update version

2005-03-26  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* output purged packages line by line like other external
	processes, rather than outputting everything all at once after the
	process finishes.

2005-03-26  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* move unset_env call to read_config, remove from all the
	binaries.  Environment is unset before reading the config, so that
	any binaries referenced in the config with ` will have the
	sanitized environment.

2005-03-26  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* always purge packages if we're building in a chroot.

2005-03-25  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* move environment cleansing to Buildd.pm unset_env cleanse
	environment from buildd-mail, buildd-watcher, and buildd-uploader,
	too.

2005-03-25  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* change length limit in changes to 990.  The RFC says 998,
	postfix's default is 990, and others are somewhere in the 998-1000
	range, or don't care...

2005-03-22  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* update version

2005-03-22  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* re-append the slave option after the config is reloaded

2005-03-20  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* setup master link before doing rebuilds, incase they
	auto-giveback

2005-03-20  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* unset all locale related environment variables at startup kill
	ssh with TERM (which is caught) instead of HUP (which isn't) watch
	for the error message when the master is dead and the socket is
	left behind (Connection refused).

	* Make the mailing of rotated logs optional.

2005-03-19  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* finish conversion of weak_no_auto to be per-dist

2005-03-19  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* add comment indicating that the socket must be a relative path

2005-03-18  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix case where $conf::should_build_msgs is off to only build the
	prevfailed package once.

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix kill parameters and check for existence of the socket before
	starting a new master.

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix missing package qualifiers

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* kill the ssh process before exiting or shutting down

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Revert wait-for-sbuild test, the extra check for ssh isn't
	needed.

	* Add socket support to buildd-mail and buildd-uploader

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* add support for ssh 3.9's -M and -S options.  set
	$conf::sshsocket to the filename for the socket.  Requires ssh 3.9
	on both ends, and doesn't attempt to fall back if you have an
	older version installed.

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* fix $conf::should_build_msgs and setting $conf::nice_level to 0

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* build weak_no_auto packages at the end of each dist, rather than
	after all dists, making it useful for security buildds.

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* add missing file handle

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Split changes files sent in the log correctly, every 1000
	characters, to better behave the mail RFCs.

2005-03-16  Ryan Murray  <rmurray@debian.org>

	* Misc cleanups to the source:

	* Add license to repository.

	* Update FSF address.

	* Update Copyright.
